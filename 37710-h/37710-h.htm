<p class="p2 center">CHAPTER I</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="left65 smcap">Green Hill</span>, June</p>

<p>A new doctor has arrived in Green Hill!</p>

<p>Sarah told me so this morning when she brought in my
breakfast. She set the tray down with an agitated thump,
and after her strong arms had raised me a little higher
among the pillows, she stepped back, folded her hands
beneath her apron, and fixed me with a portentous eye.</p>

<p>"Now do try and relish your breakfast, Miss Mavis,"
she coaxed, "there's a good girl!"</p>

<p>An undercurrent of excitement colored her tone. I
looked upon her with suspicion. But I know my Sarah.
Like Fate, and the village fire-company, she is not to be
hurried. Very casually, I reached for my glass of milk.
Years of lying comparatively flat on a useless back tend
to the development of patience as a necessity.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" I inquired conversationally.</p>

<p>"Past nine."</p>

<p>I set the glass aside, and bit reflectively into a crisp
triangle of toast. Since I've become so clever at eating
and drinking, there's a sense of adventure about these
commonplace functions which no whole person could ever
comprehend. Sarah, busying herself with details of window-shades
and counterpanes, watching me meanwhile
from the corner of her eye, waited until I had turned indifferently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
to my pillows again, before making the following
terse but thrilling remark.</p>

<p>"Your pink rose-bush's come into blossom, Miss
Mavis."</p>

<p>Here was news indeed! My unconcern took unto itself
wings and flew away.</p>

<p>"Not really!" I cried, "Oh, Sarah, how perfectly
darling of her to waken so early!"</p>

<p>Sarah, accustomed to my extravagant fashion of endowing
all growing things with distinct personalities,
nodded gravely. And then, with all the majesty of Jove&mdash;if
one may picture that deity as female, fifty, and New
England incarnate&mdash;she launched her thunderbolt of
Green Hill gossip.</p>

<p>"That young doctor&mdash;him that was to come from the
city to help Doctor McAllister with his patien's&mdash;he's
here!"</p>

<p>There was more truth than enunciation in Sarah's
neglect of that final "t" in patients. Our village doctor
is long on wisdom, but short of temper. I reached out
for the morning paper, lying on my bedside table, and
rustled it in dismissal.</p>

<p>"How interesting!" I murmured, successfully concealing
any concern at all.</p>

<p>Sarah swooped down upon my tray and bore it to the
door, in a manner which carried conviction. But we can
deceive each other so little, Sarah and I.</p>

<p>"Come last night," she volunteered, "from New York.
And every girl in Green Hill is furbishing up her Sunday
clothes, so Sammy said."</p>

<p>Sammy, surnamed Simpson, the freckled-faced Mercury
who delivers the milk, and is in close touch with all
the divers heart-throbs of Green Hill, holds a sentimental,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
if unacknowledged appeal for Sarah. A century or two
ago, Sammy's father, in those days a gay and unencumbered
spark, courted my Sarah, so runs the story, in the
public manner of Green Hill. And Sarah, difficult to believe
though it be, showed him no disfavor. There was,
however, an obstacle to eventual union, in the person of
Sarah's invalid mother, a querulous, ninety-pound tyrant.
Upon this rock the frail bark of the Simpson affections
shattered. This is of history, the most ancient, but had
the far-reaching result that Sarah, whose lot seems ever
cast among the stricken, now waits on me heart, hand,
and foot, while over the Simpson hearthstone another
goddess presides, and rigidly too, if one can judge from
the harrassed expressions of Sammy, Sr., Sammy, Jr.,
and all the other innumerable Simpson olive branches.</p>

<p>But to return to our muttons&mdash;the palpitating girlhood
of Green Hill.</p>

<p>"Silly geese!" I commented unkindly.</p>

<p>Sarah from the doorway looked as cryptic as is consistent
with the features Nature had given her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know!" she answered with spirit, and
an unconscious effect of argot, "In Green Hill, Miss
Mavis, men is scarce!"</p>

<p>Here was truth! Mentally I echoed, "They is!" and
Sarah, reading ratification in my silence, achieved a disappearance
of my tray, and returned to the attack.</p>

<p>"Sammy says&mdash;he was down to the station last
night when the ten-six come in&mdash;seems like," she digressed,
"he's always hanging around the station since
Rosie Allan's been telegraph operator there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rosie is a very pretty girl, Sarah," I chided gently.</p>

<p>"Pretty is as pretty does!" said Sarah, in irrefutable
self-defense. "Limb, I call her&mdash;bold as brass! But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
then," she added in her most pleasant tone, "Sammy
was never raised to know better." And she looked at
me with that unique light in her eyes which never fails
them of the mention of any Simpson delinquency, however
slight.</p>

<p>"Sammy says," she continued, bound to pursue the
subject to the bitter end, "that the new doctor is a likely-looking
young fellow, and seems well off."</p>

<p>At this juncture, I opened my paper with an air of
finality.</p>

<p>"If this stranger in our midst is, as you infer, young,
handsome, and wealthy," I remarked, "why then, in
Heaven's name, has he descended upon Green Hill,
Sarah?"</p>

<p>I hate handsome men. They are always so much
vainer than women.</p>

<p>Sarah, accustomed as she is to my intemperate habits
of speech, regarded me with a somewhat shocked air.</p>

<p>"Sammy says," she quoted&mdash;and here the conversational
cat leaped from the bag&mdash;"that he come down
here because he is suffering from nerves!"</p>

<p>The door closed after her, but her contempt lingered,
almost tangibly, in the room; and I smothered my laughter
in the lavender-scented pillows.</p>

<p>But Sarah had given me something to think about.
I have known so few men, young ones, that perhaps I
am given to speculating about them even more than the
average girl. They're such an unknown quality. And
certainly the one or two who have been escorted to my
presence have not shown to good advantage. The
healthy man reacts unfavorably to invalid feminism.
They are bored, or too sympathetic; they speak in whispers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
or in too cheery tones; they shuffle their great feet;
and escape, eventually, with a sigh of relief. And I
am impatient of them, of their bulk and their strength,
and the arrogance which is part and parcel of their sex.
Perhaps it is because I am handicapped, circumstantially
out of the running, so as to speak, that an "eligible"
male always arouses in me a feeling of antagonism. And
yet with not unremarkable inconsistency, I always wish,
wistfully, deep down, that I might make, sometime, a
man friend of my own generation. But I can't. Something
in me shuts doors and bolts them in any strange,
masculine face.</p>

<p>A breeze stole delicately through my open window and
ruffled my hair, luring my eyes to the out-of-door world
where young Summer goes walking today, clad in blue
and green. Not far off, the hills which give our town
its pretty name, rise mistily, like altars. Just beyond that
tall tangle of oak trees, a little river comes singing from its
source. In winter I miss its friendly voice, yet I am
more in sympathy with it then, for ice-bound, its bright
limbs fettered, its dancing stilled, it seems kin to such
as I. But for me there will never dawn a springtide,
with the prison keys in her green girdle and rosy hands
outstretched to unlock the door.</p>

<p>Year in, year out, my bed is always close to the windows.
All of out-doors that I may see and hear, I must
have for my own. I love every glimpse and scent and
sound of it. Only the aggressive shriek of the train at
the distant crossing makes me shrink and shudder. That
was the last thing I heard&mdash;a whistle at a crossing&mdash;before
the day coach which was carrying me home from
a happy visit plunged over the embankment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>Eleven years ago! It seems like many centuries. Yet
I remember it as I remember yesterday&mdash;that crash
before oblivion. I can remember even the thrill of
twelve-year old pride in the dignity of that fifty-mile
journey, made quite alone. It was the beginning of a
longer journey, where the milestones are the years; a
journey painful and rebellious, marked with many stations
of weariness, and black tunnels of agony; a journey
which, despite all the loving care that surrounds me, I
must make in isolation of body and spirit. Oh, little
blue diary, it is well that I may shut away my moods
and my mutiny between your covers! No one in all
this house must be made sadder because of me. Not
father, unfailing playmate, and tender; not Sarah, whose
silent affection is like protecting arms about me. There's
a great shaft of sunlight quivering across what I've just
written. Incongruous, somehow. And I'm out of tune
with the June weather and the birds just beyond my
windows.</p>

<p>I must ask Sarah to bring me my first rose from my
Sleeping Beauty bush. First roses are always the sweetest&mdash;like
the kiss of Prince Charming.</p>

<p>I wonder what the nervous doctor's name is&mdash;poor
Sarah!</p>

<p>June paid me a visit this afternoon while I slept. She
was reluctant to waken me, but left me her prettiest card.
The first roses from my bush! They have been happily
translated to a vase beside me, as I write. Father
brought them upstairs with him when he came in for tea.</p>

<p>"Did you kiss her hands and tell her how sorry I would
be to miss her?" I asked him soberly.</p>

<p>Father looked alarmed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>"Whose hands?" he began.</p>

<p>"Who has called on us today?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Withers!" he answered, suppressing a groan.</p>

<p>Rudely I laughed.</p>

<p>"Surely, Mavis," father continued plaintively, "you
could never demand that I kiss&mdash;"</p>

<p>I laughed again. Mrs. Withers&mdash;ugly name, isn't
it!&mdash;is the wife of our pastor. She is a good woman,
but she possesses little charm.</p>

<p>I just touched my roses, with a cautious finger-tip.</p>

<p>"June has been here, you prosaic person," I said.
"Witness these, and then deny it if you can."</p>

<p>Father, relieved, leaned back in my comfortable armchair.
At least, I know it <i>looks</i> comfortable.</p>

<p>"I did not see her," he said. "That is, not until I
entered this room, and found her wearing my daughter's
most becoming face."</p>

<p>Father is so satisfactory! I'm sure I bridled.</p>

<p>"Bring me a mirror, immediately!" I demanded.</p>

<p>Father rose obediently to his lean height, and fumbled
among the things on my dresser for the fat silver mirror,
adorned with its charmingly ugly cupids, which had
been my mother's.</p>

<p>"There, Miss Vanity!" he said. And while I studied
my reflection, he studied me from under his bushy
brows.</p>

<p>Finally, in silence, I gave him back the glass.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked father.</p>

<p>"Well?" I responded, which was not courteous.</p>

<p>"Do you find yourself prettier than yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Much!" I answered, with conviction.</p>

<p>After all, there are compensations in the possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of a pointed face, decorated with big dark eyes, and a
delightful mouth. My nose has never pleased me; but
always, when I am gloomiest, my hair affords me consolation.
Sarah makes a household pet of it, and cares
for it devotedly. There's heaps of it. So much, that
it makes my head ache to wear it piled high. So it generally
lies in two long braids across the sheets.</p>

<p>"Father," I asked, "what color is my hair?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward and lifted one of the braids.</p>

<p>"Exactly the color of cloudy amber," he answered.</p>

<p>I pondered on this for a time, and then: "That," I
said, "sounds very nice&mdash;but improbable."</p>

<p>We smiled at one another, but suddenly the laughter
left his eyes, and he bent to kiss my forehead, perhaps
to hide his face.</p>

<p>"You grow more lovely every day, Mavis," he said,
gravely.</p>

<p>Could anything be sweeter than a father who says
all those little, lover things to one? I think not.</p>

<p>I laid my cheek against his hand. He has nice hands,
quick to soothe and caress. Nothing is quite unendurable
with father near.</p>

<p>"You should be a poet," I told him. "Sometimes I
think you are, instead of a historian. Nothing in the
world can ever make me believe that you write deadly-dull
books for deadly-dull people to read. Do they read
them?" I inquired as an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Mavis!" he shook his finger at me, in mock indignation.</p>

<p>"Well," I answered truthfully, "mediaeval history
must be dull. I'm sure I can't remember any of it!"</p>

<p>Here our argument, but half commenced, ceased. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
father, with an exclamation, plunged his hands deep into
his pockets, and after a time produced a slim, sober
volume.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" he cried in triumph.</p>

<p>"Here is what?" I asked in some astonishment.
"How you do dash about, father. Your mind turns
all sorts of corners. What is it&mdash;mediaeval history?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, minx! Poetry!"</p>

<p>"Poetry!"</p>

<p>He laid the book on the bed, and my hands pounced
upon it like two white cats on a small brown mouse.</p>

<p>"I've been starving for some!" I announced, and
turned the book over to read the title, <i>The Lyric Hour by
Richard Warren</i>.</p>

<p>"Where," I asked, tucking my treasure under my
pillow, "did you get it?"</p>

<p>"It came in the morning mail," he answered.</p>

<p>I looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p>"There is," I ventured, "some mystery about this
<i>Lyric Hour</i>."</p>

<p>Father laughed, and fished once more in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Here is the letter which came with it," he said.</p>

<p>I opened the envelope, which bore the name of father's
publisher and good friend, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">New York City</span><br />
June 18th</p>

<p>Dear Carroll:</p>

<p>I'm sending you your delayed proofs, and by way of
apology and distraction, the volume of verse which has
created such a sensation in literary and critical circles&mdash;those
two kingdoms which occasionally overlap&mdash;but are
not always completely allied. I feel certain that you and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Mavis will enjoy Richard Warren. Old and sedate as I
have grown with the years, I must confess that he has made
my pulses quicken and my heart take on something of its
youth again.</p>

<p>With warmest remembrances to you both,</p>

<p class="left50">
Faithfully yours,<br />
<span class="left20 smcap">John Denton</span>
</p></div>

<p>I gave the letter back to father.</p>

<p>"It must be some book!" I remarked with awe, if
slangily.</p>

<p>Father raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Denton&mdash;and 'quickened pulses'?" I quoted
with a rising inflection.</p>

<p>"Why not?" interrogated my parent. "A contemporary
of mine, and, Mavis, you must admit, an admirer
of yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was flattered into silence, and turned my attention
to my roses once more. Father chewed his pipe stem&mdash;a
reprehensible habit&mdash;and made an announcement.</p>

<p>"We've had another caller today," he said.</p>

<p>"You're as bad as Sarah for concealing things until
the eleventh hour," I reproached him. "Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Denton's nephew."</p>

<p>This, in Green Hill phraseology, really fetched me.
Round-eyed, I stared.</p>

<p>"Didn't know he had one!" I said, somewhat aggrieved.
"Who is he, and what is he doing here?"</p>

<p>Father stretched out his long legs, preparatory to explanation.</p>

<p>"It's a long story," he said. "Briefly, this is a prodigal
nephew. There has been some family feud in the
Denton clan, but recently done away with. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
hatchet was buried, Denton got into touch with his late
brother's family, which consists of a wife, and an only
son, who is a doctor. He has just recovered from a
slight break-down&mdash;overwork, I believe. And Denton
through me arranged to have him come here to recuperate
and at the same time to assist our good friend, McAllister
in some of his surgical research."</p>

<p>By this time my mind was putting two and two together
and making eight or nine.</p>

<p>"Not Doctor Denton," I asked, "<i>the</i> Doctor Denton?"</p>

<p>Father nodded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;" he began wistfully. But I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Please not!" I said. And he left me with his sentence
unspoken. But I knew! We had both read so
much of the young surgeon who had effected wonderful
cures in cases similar to mine. It had never occurred to
either of us, at the time, that he might be of John Denton's
family. But I knew that father often wished, out
loud, that he might consult with him about me, deploring
the fact that he was in Europe. But for a number of
years I have begged so hard that no more doctors be let
loose to probe and pound me&mdash;a process of infinite torture
with no results save deeper hopelessness and white
nights, that father promised. So I have been left in
peace. Lazily, I wondered why father had not told me
sooner of his discovery and subsequent arrangement with
Doctor Mac. But I had a bad siege of it, a while back,
and probably during that very period the matter had
come up. Doubtless, when I had finally struggled up
again from my depths, father, once more lost to the world
among his books, had forgotten.</p>

<p>I lay silent, watching a bird seesaw on the vine which
clambers over my window-ledge in friendly fashion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
"Long past your bed-time!" I remarked severely. But
it cheeped at me impudently.</p>

<p>I wonder what Doctor Denton looks like. Thin, I
fancy, professional, and probably very jumpy. But I
cannot condemn his nerves quite as harshly as I know
Sarah does. I have had a speaking acquaintance with
nerves, myself.</p>

<p>I meant to indulge in <i>The Lyric Hour</i> tonight. But
my little blue friend has claimed all of my time. I will
save Mr. Warren, therefore, for another day. Like icing
on a cake. The book lies under my pillow still, barely
peeped at. Perhaps I shall sleep better with that Ship
of Song beneath my cheek.</p>

<p>Diary, good night!</p>

<p class="p2 left65">Twenty-four hours later.</p>

<p>Oh, Diary, I have found him! And I don't know, and
care less, whether he is twenty or ninety, fat or thin,
married or single! The only thing in all the world which
I am sure of at present is that he is mine! For I have
him locked up between two vellum doors, from which
he shall never escape. He's here&mdash;and never in all my
life has anyone so thoroughly belonged to me. I've the
heart and brains and beautiful spirit of him, and all day
long his name makes a happy spot in my conscience.
<i>Richard Warren! Richard Warren!</i> I hold the book
that he has given to the world between my hands, in
reverence. For all that I have hoped, and dreamed, and
lived, in my shut-in life; all that I have ever wanted to
be; all, that in my secret soul-shrine I have worshipped
in God and Nature and Love of Love, is written down
here for me to read and make doubly my own. I don't
know who or what he is, Diary, in the outside world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
And it doesn't matter. Nothing matters but this one
little book to which he has set his name. For everything
worth while is here; dust of stars and wine of dreams;
essence of youth and joy of living, given word-form.
And yet, these are not words so much as they are music,
and color, and fragrance. I've just been reading and
reading, and now I've laid the book aside, and have been
lying here idly, letting broken snatches of purest beauty
drift through my mind. And, for the first time I find
myself regretting the shade of my eyes, for my new companion
sings of "grey eyes as pure as God's first dream
of stars." But perhaps it's just that grey lends itself
more easily to poetry than common or garden brown.</p>

<p>Diary, I wonder if I have fallen in love with a book!
But what a satisfactory state of heart to be in after all!
I can banish my lover with so little effort, if ever I am
not in the mood for him! I can even cast him into the
fire, if he ever bores me! And I am sure that the most
lovelorn maiden on earth must have moments when she
would envy that faculty! And when I finally relent, as all
true lovers must, how simple it has been made for me to
buy a new copy of the Beloved!</p>

<p>Good night, "sweet gossip," as the ladies of Shakespeare's
time were wont to say. You're such a comfort!
And you'll not tell, will you, that Richard Warren and
all his words lie once again beneath my pillow?</p>

<p class="p2 left65">June 21</p>

<p>It's raining. Silver fingers are tapping at my window
pane, and father's morning offering of roses came to
me with their darling faces all wet and gleaming. I
hated the weather <i>hard</i> when I woke up, but in my <i>Lyric
Hour</i>, which holds so many, many lyric hours for me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
there's a little verse about the rain, which patters through
my mind as soothingly as the drops outside. So I've
become almost reconciled to a dull day, devoid of visitors,
and with Sarah complaining of "rheumatics." I shall
begin to grumble about them myself soon, for I'm aware
of warnings in my spine which bode no good. I'm too
tired to write more, Diary.</p>

<p class="p2 left65">July 1</p>

<p>Since last I set pen to your paper, Blue One, I have
descended into Sloughs of Despair. Now, emerged
again, I take up my story where I left it. A day or so
after the last time I talked with you, I had an attack, of
the sort which has mercifully been spared me for over
a year. It had been coming on, steadily, but I wasn't
going to give in to it&mdash;oh, no! So, the first intimation
which father and Sarah had of its arrival was late one
night, when a moan that I had been biting back for an
hour tore its way to freedom past my closed lips, and
revealed its presence, surprisingly, in the shape of a
scream. Sarah came flying to my bed, and hard on her
heels, father. They gave me such remedies as are always
at hand, and which generally prove friendly. But
this time they failed. My Demon had been in abeyance
too long, and was reluctant to loosen his clutches. Once
made free of my flesh, he would listen to no reason.
Presently there came a period of half-consciousness,
through which I dimly heard father at the telephone,
calling Dr. McAllister's number. I almost smiled,
through the creeping faintness, to think how annoyed he
would profess himself to be, "called out of bed at this
ungodly hour!" and how once arrived, he would toil to
help me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>When I opened my eyes again after what seemed
years, it was with a vague sense of amazement that Doctor
Mac had grown so young since last I had seen him.
For he was slim, where once he had been inclined to
rotundity, and ruddy-brown where once he had been
sparse and grey. Upon my pulse was an unfamiliar
hand, and a strange voice, close to me, was saying quietly.</p>

<p>"She's coming round, Mr. Carroll."</p>

<p>Somehow, this calm disposition of me was annoying.</p>

<p>"I'm not," I heard myself contradict weakly.</p>

<p>Two steel-blue eyes, set in a lean face, met mine. It
was not a friendly encounter.</p>

<p>"Please don't talk," ordered this new Doctor Mac
briefly.</p>

<p>Father laid his hand upon my forehead.</p>

<p>"Is the pain better, dear?" he asked, with that break
in his voice which always comes when he knows that I
am suffering.</p>

<p>I tried to flash triumph into the blue eyes, and responded,
"Yes." Then, as My Demon's jaws took a
fresh hold on my spinal column, "Oh&mdash;no&mdash;!"</p>

<p>There was a low-voiced consultation, and then father
said, reassuringly,</p>

<p>"Don't talk, Mavis dear, and lie quiet. Doctor Denton
is going to give you something to relieve you."</p>

<p>I felt six years old again, and resentful to find father
going over to the enemy. But I was grateful, that, after
all, our own dear Doctor Mac had not been metamorphosed
into an ogre with icicle eyes. As the tiny, merciful
piston went home, I said feebly, with malice aforethought.</p>

<p>"Hello&mdash;<i>Doctor Jumpy</i>!"</p>

<p>And the last thing I saw before I fell asleep was his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
startled face. And in my first half-dreams, I found myself
repeating, childishly, "He did jump! He <i>did</i>. And
I made him!"</p>

<p>And that, Dear Diary, was my informal introduction
to the nervous nephew of Mr. John Denton.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER II</p>

<p class="p2">Doctor Denton came in this morning.</p>

<p>He has been in every day since that horror-night, and
we preserve an armed neutrality with one another. I
had even grown rather to like him, not for himself so
much as for the engaging way his hair grows, and for
the sensitive, spatulate fingers of the born surgeon. But
after his visit of this morning, my little liking has retreated,
as those crocuses which leave warm earth prematurely
are sent shuddering into nothingness by the
breath of an inimical frost. Here's what happened.</p>

<p>The roses started, and finished it. My room is quite
full of them today; everywhere I look is just a blur of
color. I think that Earth is particularly lavish this
season. When father brought Doctor Denton in, and
left us to what he fondly termed a "nice chat," the following
conversation ensued.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Carroll!"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Doctor Denton!"</p>

<p>After a few professional inquiries as to the state of
health in which the morning had found me, and my satisfactory
answers,&mdash;silence! I watched him stride restlessly
about my room, until I could stand it no longer.
Then I said briefly,</p>

<p>"Lovely day, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Came a growl, which translated I took to signify,
"Hot!"</p>

<p>I know now just how water feels, trying to wear away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the proverbial stone. Exhausted by my efforts, I leaned
back among my pillows and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>Presently Doctor Denton came, and drew a chair close
to the bed.</p>

<p>"Your roses are wonderful," he remarked conversationally.</p>

<p>Here was a subject on which I cannot fail to become
eloquent. I opened my eyes. This was a mistake, for
in so doing I met that steel-blue glance which always disconcerts
me.</p>

<p>"They are," I said, and let the opening pass.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see some there," he continued, very rudely
pointing his finger at my face.</p>

<p>I put my hands hastily to my cheeks.</p>

<p>"Now," he announced with satisfaction, "that's more
like!"</p>

<p>Diary, it <i>was</i> stupid of me to blush!</p>

<p>"You do not admire pallor?" I asked politely.</p>

<p>"Certainly not the pallor of ill-health," was the professional
answer. "It may be poetic, but it is hardly&mdash;practical."</p>

<p>"You do not admire poetry?"</p>

<p>Doctor Denton ceased twirling one of my loveliest
roses between his fingers, and leaned forward to lay it
carefully across my nearest braid. Gravely considering
the effect, he replied,</p>

<p>"Not as a steady diet."</p>

<p>I slipped my hand under my pillow and closed it down
hard over a certain volume.</p>

<p>"I do not suppose that surgery and poetry are particularly
compatible," I volunteered, with indifference.</p>

<p>He lifted the rose from my braid and regarded it
<i>silently</i>. When he looked up, I was astonished to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
a light in the Alaskan eyes which I never dreamed could
live in so cold a climate.</p>

<p>"You're all wrong," he answered; "there's a tremendous
amount of poetry in surgery,&mdash;beauty, too, and
limitless romance."</p>

<p>I didn't know those words were in his vocabulary. A
trifle stirred by his tone, I made a little <i>moue</i> of scepticism.</p>

<p>"Instruments&mdash;and white coats&mdash;and ether," I was
beginning, when he interrupted me.</p>

<p>"And beyond them all," he finished, on a deeper note,
"the poetry of healing!"</p>

<p>I fell silent. Somehow that view of things had never
occurred to me. Where one might see poetry, I saw
only pain.</p>

<p>Perhaps my face showed something of what I was
remembering, for suddenly he rose and leaned over me.</p>

<p>"Let me make you more comfortable," he suggested.
And slipping a steady arm beneath my shoulders&mdash;there's
more strength concealed in the slim length of him
than one would imagine&mdash;he held me closely, while with
the other hand he pounded my pillows and settled them
firmly again. Something slid to the floor and lay there.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, as he stooped to recover it.</p>

<p>I put out my hands, but he was turning the book over.</p>

<p>"Poetry?" he said pleasantly, and raised an eyebrow.
I didn't care much for his tone.</p>

<p>"Have you read it?" I asked belligerently.</p>

<p>"<i>The Lyric Hour</i>? No. Do you care, then, so much
for rhymesters?"</p>

<p>"For this one," I answered, annoyed to confession.</p>

<p>"That explains it!"</p>

<p>"Explains what?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>"The night you were ill," Doctor Denton went on
calmly to reveal, "you called me 'Richard.'"</p>

<p>I felt the hot color rise to my cheeks again. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Only&mdash;my name happens to be Bill."</p>

<p>"It would be," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean by that, Miss Carroll?"</p>

<p>But I only smiled angelically, and asked, "When do
you expect Doctor McAllister back again, Doctor Denton?"</p>

<p>I do not know that my tone implied all that I felt, but
I saw the steel-blue eyes grow very dark, and,</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Doctor Denton stiffly.</p>

<p>I felt somewhat ashamed, and tried to make amends.</p>

<p>"Please read <i>The Lyric Hour</i>, Doctor," I urged, in
my prettiest party voice. "You will find it really worth
while."</p>

<p>The creature is, after all, occasionally understanding.
He smiled forgivingly at me and held out his hand for
the book. But I hadn't meant that.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, hastily. "Not my copy!"</p>

<p>"As precious as all that?" he asked, putting his rejected
hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>This I ignored.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. John Denton to send you out a copy," I
suggested. "He sent us this one."</p>

<p>"The devil he did!"</p>

<p>I looked my surprise, and my visitor laughed. He has
a very nice laugh, considering.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Carroll. I am apt to be a
trifle&mdash;," he paused, and considered me narrowly, "eh&mdash;jumpy.
And I didn't know my Uncle John went in
for ethereal chaps."</p>

<p>Ethereal! The word, on those lips, was an insult! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
glared at him, rather conscious that I must look like a
sick kitten.</p>

<p>Father came in, providentially.</p>

<p>"How is she, Doctor?" he asked. Which was absurd,
as I had reassured him concerning my welfare not two
hours earlier.</p>

<p>"Rather scrappy&mdash;lots of fight left," answered our
guest, rising.</p>

<p>I was speechless.</p>

<p>"I think," said Doctor Denton, "we shall have to get
her out of doors."</p>

<p>Father and I stared at him.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he continued, looking from one of us
to the other. "We'll commence by building her up a
bit, and trying massage for those unused muscles. Then
a little later it should be quite easy to carry her comfortably
downstairs and settle her on a cot under the
trees for a little while each day."</p>

<p>"McAllister&mdash;" began father, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll talk with him," cut in Doctor Denton cheerfully.
"He will be back next week," he added, turning
deliberately to me.</p>

<p>I looked grateful.</p>

<p>"How perfectly splendid!" I said, with a ring of real
enthusiasm in my voice. "I've missed him so much!"</p>

<p>Father looked mildly surprised at so much fervor,
and I am sure the creature concealed a smile.</p>

<p>As he departed with father to "talk things over," Doctor
Denton turned at the door.</p>

<p>"Less poetry, Miss Carroll," he admonished, parentally.</p>

<p>"That's what I tell her," said father, surrendering to
the foe. "The child reads too much. It makes her
fanciful and&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>"Doesn't take her mind off herself," suggested the
doctor, nastily. I wonder, Diary, what he meant?</p>

<p>"We'll take away her books," he went on, "and give
her sunshine and fresh air and green trees, in their place."</p>

<p>Against my will I admitted it would be glorious&mdash;the
outdoors part of the program.</p>

<p>"You see," he turned to father, "doctors are rather
like gardeners. I, for one, am interested in roses."</p>

<p>"Roses?" echoed my parent, who seemed to pass from
one stage of astonishment to the other as the morning
progressed.</p>

<p>"Roses!" repeated Doctor Denton, firmly. "There's
a particularly pretty white one that I am anxious to cultivate.
I believe with care and sunlight it could be urged
to bloom quite deep pink&mdash;permanently." He looked
at me as he said this last. Then, with a polite "Good
morning, Miss Carroll!" he left the room.</p>

<p>I hate him!</p>

<p>But Diary, wouldn't it be altogether wonderful if we
could be taken out-of-doors together?</p>

<p>I wonder what that doctor person did with the flower
he stole from my vase?</p>

July 3</p>

<p>Diary, I dreamed a horrid dream last night. I dreamed
that I stood with Richard Warren on some high wooded
place&mdash;in my dreams, Diary, I can always stand&mdash;with
my hands close in his. I couldn't see his face, but I
knew him, somehow, and his voice was in my ears, just
saying my name, over and over. "<i>Mavis! Mavis!</i>"
But as the mist cleared before my eyes, someone said far
off, "Ethereal!" and laughed. And as I looked, I saw,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
not Richard Warren, Poet and Dreamer of Dreams, but
William Denton, Surgeon and Scoffer. It all sounds
so foolish, Diary, written down, but it was really quite
dreadful. Sarah, who must have heard me call out,
for in my dream I wrenched my hands away and
screamed, appeared at my bedside, like a familiar ghost.
How I welcomed her, innumerable tightly plaited braids,
and all! Breathe it not in Gath, but in this unpleasant
fashion does Sarah achieve her crinkled morning coiffure!
She tucked me in, secured a flapping shade, forced a potion
of hot milk down my unwilling throat, and left me. So,
finally, I slept again, to dream no more.</p>

<p>This morning a note came to me from Mr. Denton.
So nice a man to have so wretched a relation!</p>

July 2d</p>

<p>My dear little Mavis:</p>

<p>Your good father is so poor a correspondent that I have
struck his name from my letter-list. But you are always
considerate of a lonely old man. Therefore I write to inform
him, through you, that I am leaving this asphalt wilderness
presently, for the White Mountains. Perhaps when
my vacation there draws to a close, I may drop down to see
you before returning to the 'demnition' grind. I shall
look forward to a pleasant visit with you, and a quarrelsome
time with your father, to whom, despite his neglect of
me, I beg to be remembered.</p>

<p>I am sending you some books and some exotic fruit, hoping
to tempt your literary and physical palates, respectively.</p>

<p>My nephew writes me that he has seen you. I envy him!
But I am more than sorry, my dear, that your first encounter
should have taken place under such unfortunate
circumstances. I shall be grateful to you for any kindness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
you care to show him, for he has not had a very happy,
albeit successful, career, and he is far from his Western
home and his people.</p>

<p>Remember me to your elderly and amiable handmaiden,
whose beaten biscuit I recall with such felicity.</p>

<p>Write me now and then, Mavis, and if I can in any way
be of service to you, you have but to command me.</p>

<p>
Faithfully and affectionately your friend,</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">John Denton</span></p>

<p>P.S. How did you like <i>The Lyric Hour</i>?</p>
</div>

<p>This afternoon the fruit and books arrived. Quantities
of both. Sammy Simpson, Jr., who adds the arduous
duties of expressman to those of milk purveyor,
staggered upstairs under the burden of them. Into this
very room, with his own hands, ably chaperoned by
Sarah, he brought them. We had a little conversation.
It ran something like this.</p>

<p>Mavis: "Good afternoon, Sammy!"</p>

<p>Sammy: "Afternoon, Miss Mavis!"</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash;;: "How is everyone at home, Sammy?"</p>

<p>S&mdash;&mdash;: "Pretty fair, thank you."</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash;: "Anything exciting happen in Green Hill
lately, Sammy?"</p>

<p>S&mdash;&mdash;: "Nothin' in perticular, Miss Mavis."</p>

<p>Here Sarah made a remark.</p>

<p>"Why, Sammy, you told me yourself, not ten minutes
back, that your folks found old man Thomas hanging
to the rafters of his own barn this morning!"</p>

<p>Sammy, in deep disgust, "Oh, him!"</p>

<p>Sarah, sharply, "Suppose you think a hanging aint
nothing worth mentioning, Sammy!"</p>

<p>To which the youth, defensively,</p>

<p>"Well, it kinder slipped my mind."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Sammy," I here ejaculated, with real horror,
"that's dreadful!"</p>

<p>Sammy shifted to his other foot for a change.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," he remarked. "Paw found him. That's
the third man," he continued with satisfaction, "that
Paw's cut down. He never did have much luck."</p>

<p>Sarah looked triumphant. I, making a miraculous recovery,
inquired,</p>

<p>"I wonder why he did such a thing&mdash;Mr. Thomas, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Wife druv him," volunteered Sammy cheerfully.</p>

<p>I tried to appear shocked, but Sarah answered with
bitterness,</p>

<p>"Couldn't stand living with himself any longer, like
as not."</p>

<p>But Sammy, ignoring her, turned to me and said with
conviction,</p>

<p>"Wimmen, Miss Mavis, is the dickens!"</p>

<p>Here the conversation ended. Sammy departed with
a tug of his tow forelock, doubtless a legacy from ancestors
who now sleep quietly across the ocean. Sarah
bustled him out of the room, as one shoos chickens, and
I lay back on my pillows and laughed. There is more to
Sammy's melancholy than meets the eye. I seem to see
Rosie Allan's fine Yankee hand in this. However, sooner
or later I shall solve the mystery, for all Green Hill
comes, now and again, to this peaceful room.</p>

<p>I've peeped into my new books, and nibbled at something
which starts out by acting like a peach and ends
up by becoming an apricot. And now I will write
to my Fairy Godfather. For I have a Great Idea,
Diary, which I will not confide to you until it has taken
shape.

July 4</p>

<p>We've been celebrating today! Even unto firecrackers
under my window&mdash;I am only grateful that they were
not under my bed! Doctor Denton, who arrived this
morning with Doctor Mac in tow, unbent sufficiently to
present me with a small silk flag. I was coldly sweet to
him, but warmly so to his companion. It's nice to have
Doctor Mac at home&mdash;language, beetle-brows, and all!
He was led into the room by his younger colleague, and
brought to my bedside, with an air of "Eureka! Behold
my handiwork!"</p>

<p>Doctor Mac is very much pleased with my appearance&mdash;from
a medical standpoint&mdash;and before the two of
them departed, it was practically settled that I should
begin the massage so that the out-of-doors campaign
might be started.</p>

<p>I informed Doctor Denton that I had a letter from his
uncle, to which he remarked.</p>

<p>"Didn't know you corresponded!"</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the news appeared to annoy him.</p>

<p>Diary, here is the letter which went to the White
Mountains today. May your covers turn red if ever you
divulge it!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Green Hill</span><br />
July 4th</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Denton:</p>

<p>First of all, a thousand thanks for your letter, the books,
and the fruit. But how can you prate of 'fruit' in so commonplace
a fashion, and then shower me with works of art,
full of delicious mystery? Sarah says she fears I shall never
be satisfied with Green Hill fare again. I believe she has
grounds. The books are most welcome. I've been peering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
at Wells, and peeking at Bennett, and holding my breath
over the Barrie plays. I shall gorge myself on the printed
page during the next few weeks. The dearest of all is
an old friend who comes to me in a new dress. How in the
world did you remember my passion for <i>Alice</i>, and her unchanging
<i>Wonderland</i>? My own copy is worn and dog-eared.
But this <i>Alice</i> is fresh and smiling&mdash;the illustrations are too
quaint&mdash;and I love her already. Thanks, and again, thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, Doctor Denton has become a frequent visitor at the
Carroll Cottage. Father likes him very much and they have
lengthy arguments in the study, evenings. Sometimes a
detached word or the scent of a pipe drifts up to me through
the open door, and, occasionally, the two come and sit with
me awhile. It was a great surprise to me to discover your
nephew in our new doctor. One would never dream that
you belonged together.</p>

<p>I am sure that father is glad to have some one to play
with. There is no question of being 'kind.' At all events,
Doctor Denton does not appear to me a lonely person. On
the contrary.</p>

<p><i>The Lyric Hour</i> and I are intimates. I have never had
a book mean so much to me, not even <i>Alice</i>, who keeps me
alive. I wonder if you know the author of these exquisite
verses? Please, if you do, do not tell me anything about
him, but&mdash;do you think I might write to him? I should
like to tell him of the pleasure he has given me, and I
should like to tell him through you. I'd rather he did
not know my name. This may sound very foolish, as I
know that writers have many letters from the public, but
we shut-in people have moods. I would love to get to
know him a little, on paper. Do you think he would mind?
Somehow, from his book, I feel he might understand.</p>

<p>Father wouldn't care, I am sure. The Queen can do no
wrong! So if you have no objection to playing postman,
nothing remains for me save to select a new pen and commence
my letter. But I will not do that until I hear from you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>All in this house send love, except Sarah, who, I am
sure, would not think it quite proper. But she would tender
her respectful regards to you, did she know I was writing.</p>

know not.</p>

<p>Diary, I am afflicted with the morning-after sensation.
I wish I had not written to Mr. Denton. What will he
think of me? And yet, it seems almost justifiable, after
all. For surely I am quite bed-ridden enough not to have
my impulses questioned or to be accused of a sentimental,
ulterior motive. And it is certainly patent to the most
out-and-out sceptic that I shall have to get all my Romance
vicariously.</p>

<p>It's a nice day. Peter-who-lives-next-door came in
this morning to display an infinitesimal, bandaged thumb.
He "sat on a firecracker," he said, which seems to have
had an odd reaction. Peter has been so busy growing up
of late that every time he hurtles into my quiet room I
am convinced that I can see him sprout. He has a cupboard
love for Sarah, but I think that his affection for me
is simon-pure. Little boys are awfully dear. I have a
proprietary interest in Peter. The night he was born I
watched the lights of the house next door until my eyes
closed of themselves. And ever since he was a round,
big-eyed baby, he has had the freedom of this house.
Today, he sat upon my bed and informed me that he was
"goin' visitin'." I gather that his mother, Mrs. Goodrich,
has a school friend who is spending the summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
some forty miles away, at a small hotel. I asked Peter if
he were eager to go.</p>

<p>"And leave me?" I asked plaintively.</p>

<p>"I'll be home soon," answered Peter, evasively. "An'
Aunt Lily's awful nice&mdash;but awful old&mdash;as old as
Mother," added the ungallant child.</p>

<p>Peter is seven. His pretty mother is twenty-eight!</p>

<p>I envy Mrs. Goodrich very much. I envy her Peter
with a passion almost pain; and now I find myself envying
her a school friend! Girls, young women, are almost
as strange to me as men. Those I know in Green Hill
are charming creatures and very sweet to me. They
come to me with their knitting, their sewing, their love
affairs. But a community of interests is not ours. As
they chatter on, I can only wonder wistfully what it must
be like to golf and swim, ride and play tennis, picnic and
dance; to do all the "every day" things which they take
so much for granted.</p>

<p>Dr. Denton came in today to see how I had recovered
from "the Fourth," and, his call coinciding with the tail-end
of Peter's visit, the two, who had hitherto had but
a "bowing acquaintance," as the doctor put it, became
instantly the best of friends. I wish I liked John Denton's
nephew better. I am forced to agree with father
that he has many splendid qualities. But only my mind
agrees. Once or twice, when father has been particularly
expansive on the subject, I have caught him looking at
me in a puzzled fashion, and have realized that my tone
has been about as enthusiastic as a Yale adherent when
Harvard is making a goal. (Yes, Diary, I read the papers
and ask quite intelligent questions!) When Dr.
Denton is the subject in question between my father and
me I am polite, very just, but unemotional. He arouses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
in me a feeling of rebellion and plain "cussedness." Perhaps
it is a case of "Dr. Fell." I do not know, for until
recently Dr. Fell has always seemed a rather maligned
and misunderstood character to me. But not now. And
yet, digging further in the soil of spontaneous antagonism,
I am forced to confess that my dislike is deeper and even
more illogically rooted. It is not pleasant to meet a
strange young man, when one is flat on one's ridiculous
back, with no personality other than the ugly, ignominious
one of pain.</p>

<p>Let us be frank, Diary. I am irritated to be looked
upon as an "interesting case." It hurts my pride, it
wounds my vanity, it affronts me. This is not a pretty
confession, but, after all, was I not intended for other
uses than that one? It is small comfort to consider that
my "history" is tabulated and filed in many an imposing
medical office, and that one misguided wretch once wrote
an article about me for the <i>Medical World</i>.</p>

<p>Other girls have pleasanter publicity to look back upon;
thrilling scrap-books of clippings from local papers, little
prosaic bits of paper that despite the bored phraseology
of a reporter are just so many shining feathers from the
wings of Romance. They run something like this:
"Miss Ella Smith has returned to college." "Miss Ella
Smith was the hostess at a very charming dinner dance
last evening in her residence on Elm Avenue. This affair,
which marked the debut of one of Green Hill's most
popular members of the younger set, was etc., etc."
"The announcement of the engagement of Miss Ella
Smith to Howard Anderson, son of the president of the
Washington Park Bank, was made yesterday at a luncheon
given for Miss Ella Smith by Mrs. Arthur Jones."
And then, Diary, after half a column for the wedding and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the "Voice that Breathed o'er Eden" accompaniment,
perhaps some day, this: "Born, to Mr. and Mrs. Howard
Anderson (n&eacute;e Ella Smith), a son, Howard Anderson,
Junior."</p>

<p>And after that, of course, the white-bound <i>Baby Book</i>.
My mother kept one of me. Absurd pictures are in it, a
lock of yellow hair, and all sorts of dear, foolish comments.
Even my first word is written there, with, I
know, a vainglorious pen. The word is not startling. It
is "birdie." Father has often told me that mother declared
this initial effort of speech a direct sign of abnormal
brilliancy on my part, as the dictionary meaning of my
christian name is "European song thrush or throstle."</p>

<p>I wonder if even a throstle would not get out of tune
were it sentenced to life-long captivity?</p>

<p>I am terribly restless of late. I think that both father
and Sarah have noticed it. But they have said nothing.
In winter, I lie almost dormant, but Spring breeds a fever
in my blood, and Summer sets me frantic with the longing
to be up and out and away. But of all the hours, I
love the one, toward twilight, before sunset, when the
light is long and level, and a mellow golden. A breeze
springs up and whispers gently in the trees, and I come
nearest of all then to a sense of peace and quietude. This
hour is, I think, of all summer hours the one most significant
of her. In winter, one does not find the day entering
imperceptibly into that period of lovely transition; in
winter, one has daylight and then darkness.</p>

<p>Bedtime, Diary. The stars are thick tonight, and I
can see the fireflies on the grass below my window, in
pretty competition with the high, still light in the sky.
Good-night! If I have been cross and rebellious in this
writing, forgive me. It's only in books that a shut-in is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
angelic all the time! And even if I do write down my
revolts and teacup revolutions in a book, I am still very
far from being a heroine!</p>

<p>I wonder&mdash;will Mr. Denton consent to the alien role
of go-between and accomplice?

A Maker of Songs:</p>

<p>With your <i>Lyric Hour</i> close beside me, and a picture of
you in my imagination, I can feel little hesitancy in writing
to tell you, as best I can, all that your poems have meant
to me. I am, briefly, a "shut-in," in whose whole limited
life books must necessarily play a greater part than in the
active world of the well person.</p>

<p>Not long since, through Mr. John Denton, your verses
came to me. Straight into my hands they came, and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
there into my heart. They are singing there now. And for
this, my little note carries you real gratitude. It must go
to you, however, without name or sign. I'd rather that you
stayed a little "unreal." For when names and addresses
begin to play their part, then convention steps in to lay forbidding
hands on the lips of friendly impulse,&mdash;even here
in my castle, from which the outside world is almost banished,
and which I shall never leave.</p>

<p>Dear Stranger-Lady:</p>

<p>I have your letter, and have asked our mutual friend to
forward my reply to you. I am so glad that you did not
allow Mrs. Grundy to enter that rose-grey bower of yours,
which sounds so attractive. I am sure she would find the
color scheme most unbecoming!</p>

<p>I am so glad that you care for my book. It is my first,
and I have a weakness for it. I am afraid I do not sing
for the many, but for the few. Time was, when I had
hoped to be minstrel for all the world, but that is past now.
And I am content with what I do, if it can call forth letters
like yours.</p>

<p>Will you not write me again, and tell me as much of yourself
as you care to? Or am I asking too much? I hope not,
for your letter has given me such pleasure. It has made
a little happy spot for me along the way, an oasis in that
Desert of Loneliness which all of us know so well.</p>

<p>It is hard to think of you as really "shut-in." Somehow,
I make a different mental picture of you.</p>

<p>If you will let me write to you, you will have to bear with
<i>hearing</i> me tell of my dreams. But I am sure you could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
not treat them other than gently. And perhaps we can make
for each other a little rendezvous of pen and ink, where we

July 14th</p>

<p>Dear and Friendly Unknown:</p>

<p>Thank you for your letter. I shall be glad to share my
quiet days with you.</p>

<p>You ask me about myself.</p>

<p>Well, first of all, there's Father; and second, there is
Sarah. In order to rightly visualize Father, you must
imagine all the strength and gentleness in the world, made
man. And to be truly aware of Sarah, you must picture
an aging fairy, who brings you just what you want on
trays and things, before you know you want them; who
creeps in to tuck you up before you realize you are about
to grow chilly. Father is big and grey and brown; Sarah
is like New England, just before spring; very reticent, and
most tender beneath a wintry exterior. She has been nurse
and servant, mother and friend to me, since that day when,
after the doctors had agreed that there was no open door
through which I might escape into health again, they brought
me back here to live out the rest of my life. And of course
no category would be complete without a mention of Peter,
who is quite the most delightful lover that ever a girl could
have.</p>

<p>Then there's our cottage, a small red edifice, rather
weather-beaten. It is close to the hills; I think that they
care for it, in so friendly a manner do they regard its very
windows. In spring it is very intimate with the apple blossoms,
which toss rosy sprays into the crystal air to break
about its feet. In summer, as now, the roses pour white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and red and golden wine on the doorstep. In autumn, the
gayest leaves come drifting by to settle on the verandah, and
even the snow seems to like it, so high and white does it
heap itself about the doors.</p>

<p>Inside, the very best of the house is in my room. Father
calls it the "Heart of the Home." If it is that, it beats
in grey and rose, and lovely old blue. Grey in the walls and
floor, and rose and blue in the cretonnes of curtains and
mahogany furniture. All day long I lie in a four-poster
bed, which belonged to a great, great, grandmamma, and
is stationed in a big bay-window. I can look out over the
hills, which in fancy I am always climbing. Many people
come to see me here. They bring me their troubles and
their joys, and I suffer and am glad with them, vicariously.
One by one you shall meet them as our correspondence continues.
For indeed, I hope it will. But with just one condition.
Never by hook or crook or dark wiles, must you
procure my name from our "postman." For then the spell
will break, and I will vanish like the apparitions in the fairy
stories.</p>

<p>That blot is where I stopped to look at an absurd cow
which wandered slowly across my line of vision, over the
road and into the orchard. Such an amusing and defiant
tail! So melancholy an eye!</p>

<p>It has been raining this morning, and now there is palest
sunlight through veils of mist. Somewhere, a bird is being
very happy about something. Through an open window
comes the fragrance of growing, rain-wet things. Surely
you, city-bound, miss half of life.</p>

<p>I hear Sarah approaching. That means luncheon. So
I must leave you, Poet. This is such a charming game,
solitaire with an unseen partner, that I am loath to lay
aside the cards.</p>

<p>Poet, good afternoon!</p>

<p>Enchanted Princess:
</p>

<p>Your letters travel so long a route to reach me that I
tremble lest sometime they should grow weary and stop off
permanently, on the way. Will you not send them direct
to the Yale Club? I am in and out of town all week, and
will always go there for my mail. I, of course, shall have
to stick to the White Mountain itinerary. But your word is
law.</p>

<p>I was very glad to hear about the King and the Lady-in-Waiting
and the Castle. Yet it is yourself I want a pen-sketch
of. On second thoughts, perhaps, unconsciously, you
are making it for me.</p>

<p>I live&mdash;but no, it would never do to tell you! I shall
have to move in order to provide a poet with a less prosaic
setting. I am desolate in having no Sarah to anticipate
my wants; and&mdash;no Father. However, tucked away,
where no one can steal her from me, I possess a Mother!
A mother with tiny hands and feet, and the prettiest red
hair in the world. This is too bewildering a shade for a
Mother's hair to flaunt! She has added charm to beauty
by acquiring somewhere merry blue eyes, with an Irish
twinkle in them. And a kindly angel has set these jewels
deftly in the sweetest face. You would love her, I know,
and I am generously willing to share her with you if in
return I may claim a bit of your Father. Between us we
could manage to own a perfectly good pair of parents,
couldn't we?</p>

<p>But for the sake of my peace of mind, will you translate,
interpret, or explain "Peter" to me?</p>

<p>Do tell me about your visitors! Do they come to see you&mdash;I
beg your pardon! I mean, do gallant knights ever
gallop up to the drawbridge on coal-black chargers, and
blow lustily on a silver trumpet, at the postern gate&mdash;whatever
that is!&mdash;for admission? And does a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
lady ever graciously bid her varlets give them entrance?
Tell me this, and what you read, and what you think. And
if you will whisper to me, just how many years have left
you lovelier than the year before, I will confess to you that
I am Way-Past-Thirty!</p>

<p>Dear Merlin:</p>

<p>He was an aged wizard, you know.</p>

<p>Your letter has been here for several days, but I have
not been very well. Now I'm all-better, and the answer
goes to you.</p>

<p>First of all, you may indeed have a small interest in
Father. This is how much you tempt me with your description
of your Mother. Will you give her my love? Mother
must be a very precious person. Mine I can hardly remember.
But I know she was sweet and good and beautiful.
It doesn't seem possible that anyone's mother could be anything
else. My Mother was very young when she died, and
although the lack of her is sometimes very hard to bear, I
am grateful always that her eyes closed on the sight of me,
sturdy, laughing, sound! Not as I am now, a bit of human
wreckage. I wonder if she knows? There are moments
before dawn when I seem to feel her lean over me, and
her tears are on my face. But I know that God is merciful,
and because of this I think the Dear Dead may not see us.
Else, how were it Heaven?</p>

<p>Is it very hard to be Way-Past-Thirty? I am twenty-three&mdash;a
great old age, if one stops to consider it.</p>

<p>Of course I have "Gentlemen Guests"! I am not too
old for that! There's Father, every day; and occasionally
Sammy Simpson. Then there is Peter, who lives next door.
He would be flattered at your interest. Peter is seven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
and the proud possessor of a place where teeth once were.
I regret to state that he employs this aperture for an immortal,
if not conventional purpose. "It is quite easy,"
he once earnestly confided to me, "once you get the nick
of it!" Peter, his mother, and his baby sister, are away
on a visit, and I miss my little friend.</p>

<p>I suppose my doctor comes under the category of Male
Visitor. He is sixty, very crusty, but human and dear.
There's another Medical Person, too. But he doesn't count.</p>

<p class="left50">
Good-by for a little, Merlin,<br />

July 29th</p>

<p>Your Royal Delightfulness:</p>

<p>I am so sorry you've not been well. I can't bear to think
that you should suffer pain. What plucky creatures women
are! I wonder that they are created from the same clay
as great, blundering, hulks of masculinity!</p>

<p>When my letter remained so long unanswered, I began to
fear that it had never experienced the joy of coming to you.
I began to worry lest I had offended and alienated you. Indeed,
Princess, I began to think all manner of dreadful things!
This must never happen again, for I am sure I have a brand-new
crop of grey hair! Mind now!</p>

<p>Your visiting list is interesting. Sammy Simpson I approve,
if only for the euphony of his name. Peter, and
your grouchy physician, have charm. But who is the doctor
who 'does not count'? I am always suspicious of a
man when a girl says so venomous a thing about him! Do
tell me! Doctors are all very well, in their way, and sometimes
I think we songsters try to doctor, too, just a bit.
It is of course not healing of broken bones, of wounds and
fevers, that we try to bring the world, but of broken hearts,
and the wounds of every day, of fevers of too much earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and restlessness. I do not suppose we can hope to cure, but
perhaps we can provide, occasionally, a draught which drugs
for a little into Forgetfulness.</p>

<p>No, Princess, I do not think that the Dead can see us. At
least, not with the eyes of earth. But they watch over us,
perhaps, with a clearer sight than we may know, and see
beyond today and beyond the flesh, and are content, knowing
with God that all things work toward eventual Good.</p>

<p>Now that we have brought the family into it, please remember
me admiringly to your father.</p>

<p>Dear Minstrel Man:</p>

<p>Please, do you love <i>Alice</i>? I have been spending such a
pleasant hour with her. Peter, returned from his travels,
arrived this morning with my breakfast tray, and your letter.
After we had exhausted the raptures of welcome, and
Peter, his enunciation somewhat impaired by toast, had told
me all there is to know about 'Auntie Perkins,' 'Uncle Perkins,'
and the 'Fat Boarder,' he demanded a 'story.' So,
as my own inventive faculties seem a little out of repair,&mdash;I
took him with me, a willing captive, to the Rabbit Hole,
and beyond. Yes, I am sure you love <i>Alice</i>, Poet. No
Poet could be entirely grown-up. I wish you could see my
new edition of the House where she lives. It is charming,
and came to me from our Fairy-Godfather-Postman.</p>

<p>Last night I saw a shooting star. I suppose it was heralding
August, the month of these flying flames. As a child
I always thought that the Angels were shoeing the horses
which drew the chariot of the sun, and that these were
stray sparks from the Heavenly Anvil. I do not know
that I was so very wrong, after all! Everything beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
must be a spark of the Plan which is being forged in that
Divine Smithy.</p>

<p>Do you wish on shooting stars? I do! Always the same
wish. All my life, I've played at just such silly games.
Perhaps we all of us do in different ways. A thousand
years ago, when a certain great poet was a child, did ever
he refrain from stepping on cracks, as he went whistling
to school? If one is careful, you know, and reaches one's
destination in triumph, it may mean much. A new hair-ribbon,
absolution for a tiny sin, rice pudding for supper.
But perhaps you were never naughty. I am sure you didn't
wear hair-ribbons, and&mdash;but this is hard to believe&mdash;possibly
you don't like rice pudding! You couldn't resist
Sarah's, I am sure!</p>

<p>I&mdash;I wish on hay wagons. I adore odd numbers. Particularly
do I revel in thirteen. At the same time, my defiance
ends there. I cannot spill salt without a shudder, and
first stars and baby moons are burdened with my desires.
I am sure that every wish would come true, and the veriest
pebble turn an infallible talisman in my hand, if only I believed
enough.</p>

<p>There's a sunset behaving riotously outside. I am sure
that it appears much more sedate in New York!</p>

<p class="left50">Whimsically yours,<br />
<span class="smcap left20">H.R.H. Me</span></p>

exasperating.</p>

<p>Dear Princess:</p>

<p>If Denton may send you books, so may I. In this mail
three friends of mine go to you: <i>A Romance of the Nursery</i>,
<i>Paul and Fiametta</i>, and Grahame's <i>Golden Age</i>. Please
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
be kind to them. I rather think you must be like Fiametta,&mdash;a
slim, brown child, with oval face, and curious, parti-colored
hair dark as the oak-settle in the hall&mdash;that the
sunshine burnished into brightness.</p>

<p>I dreamed of you last night, an adventurous dream. Some
day I will write you about it. Not now!</p>

<p>With the books I am sending you a talisman. I hope it
will bring you all you wish. Of course, I do not know, but
I have told it to try. There is a secret hidden at its heart.
But I do not believe that you can find it out all by yourself.
That would take a Poet! Now write me, and tell me how
egotistical I am! But remember, after all, I am nothing
more or less than Mere Man.</p>

<p>Have I in any way offended you? I have had no word

to your library. Or is it the talisman? I hope not!

<p>How very rude you must think me, dear friend! For
several days have passed, and I have not yet thanked you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
for the books, and for the curiously carven piece of jade,
which you assure me will bring me my heart's desire. It
lies close in my left hand as I write. I like the cool touch
of it. And what a beautiful color it is, like the very heart
of Summer! But you should not have robbed yourself of
anything so precious.</p>

<p>The books are delightful. I wonder if one reads one's
self into every book! Your choice of friends is faultless.
I have fallen desperately in love with "Paul," already. But
"Fiametta" and I are not alike. For where she is brown,
I am white, and where her face is oval, mine is pointed, and
where her hair is oak-and-gold, mine is just yellow-and-brown!
And you know perfectly well that I am no longer
ten. Except perhaps when Peter urges me to be.</p>

<p>And now I have a Something-Lovely to share with you!
Also, it is the main reason why I have not let you hear from
me before. In a few days I'm to be carried downstairs&mdash;and
out under the trees, where an ingenious cot awaits my
occupancy. For several days I have been preparing. The
Disagreeable Doctor insists, and Father and our own Medicine
Man aid and abet him. There's been a large Scandinavian
Lady here every day. She possesses strong hands
and a cloudy accent. And I am informed that she is to be
the Witch who will remove certain fetters from my circulation.
I have wished on my talisman that she may be successful.
You see, I can't be very sanguine about it, for they
tried all manner of things of this sort long ago, and to no
avail. But, O Poet, if ever I get out under the trees again!
Once there, how my spirit will strain at the leash of my
body, to be off and away, over the hills!</p>

<p>I've not told you before of our breath-taking plan, lest it
not come true!</p>

<p>What did you dream, Poet, and will you not tell me the
Secret?</p>

<p class="left65">
Gratefully yours,<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>P.S. Paul, Fiametta, Alice, and other of your intimates,
wish to be affectionately remembered. And Peter wants to
know if you are by chance a Scout. It is the ambition of
his life to attain the age of twelve and his modern knighthood.</p>

<p>Kind Princess:</p>

<p>Your letter of the seventh has reached me. It must have
crossed mine. I began to feel happier directly I had written.
So I must have known that you were writing too! Thank
you for absolving me!</p>

<p>Your news is good news indeed! But I must know who
is to have the joy of carrying you out into the sunshine,
which is your birthright. The Old Unpleasant Doctor?
The Young and even More Unpleasant Doctor?</p>

<p>I think perhaps you had better arrange to have your
father play magician!</p>

<p>I have had a letter from my mother. There's a message for
you in it. Obediently, I quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Please tell the Unknown Lady that I have received her
love, and am taking care of it. I wish I could run in to visit
with her in that rose-grey room. But it wouldn't do at all!
Not with my hair! Tell her she must have it done over in
blues and browns before I can put in an appearance. The
years, thank God, whatever else they take, still leave me my
vanity! Give the Princess my love, and ask her if rose-and-grey
bedsocks would become her feet. Size, too, please."</p>
</div>

<p>There's more to it, only if I should quote further you'd
grow aware how much I have written her about you, and
just what I have said. And that would never do. But you
can see for yourself how well brought up I am. Confiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
in my maternal parent! Did you know the verses were
dedicated to her?</p>

<p>No! I will not tell you my dream, nor what the Talisman
is hiding from you. If I did, you would lose all interest,
for I should no longer be a Man of Mystery!</p>

<p>Will you tell an egotistical male just which verse most
pleases you? And of course you will let me hear directly
you leave the Castle?</p>

<p class="left50">Yours<br />
<span class="smcap left20">Richard Warren</span></p>

<p>Please congratulate Peter for me on his aspirations. Tell
him that although hoary beyond belief, I too have always
yearned to be a Scout&mdash;a good one!</p>

<p>How dare you have secrets? Is that not Woman's prerogative?
I will not answer any of your questions today,
nor, indeed, write to you at all. Instead, I will write to

<p>(Enclosure)<br />
Dear Mother of the Poet:</p>

<p>Your son has written me your message. It is lovely of
you to understand. And you <i>do</i> understand, do you not,
just how much this pleasant pen-and-ink friendship means
to me in my restricted world, bound as it is by walls, north
and south, east and west.</p>

<p>The bedsocks sound beautiful. I have some severe gray
ones which always make me feel very plain. But Sarah,
who fashioned them, has little imagination. It is dear of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
you to want to knit for me, and when the cold nights come,
I shall welcome your gift! About size three, I should say.</p>

<p>Mr. Warren writes me that <i>The Lyric Hour</i> is dedicated
to you. I have turned to the page and read it with new eyes.
"To the Dearest of All." And I am sure that the poem which
is my favorite is your own. It is the one which begins</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="i0">For this, the patience of your Love,</span>
<span class="i1">The pride which gives me wings.</span>
<span class="i0">Dearest, my gratitude....</span></p></div>

<p>If only I could say it in verse, what a thankful little
poem would go to you now! But I can only sign myself,</p>

<p>Cruel Princess!</p>

<p>My head is in the dust! Such an uncomfortable place for
it, too! Reluctantly, I have forwarded to my mother the
letter which should have been mine. I have read it, every
word! Surely that snippy little note, in which you call me&mdash;me,
a perfect stranger&mdash;names! cannot be considered a
real letter! On second thoughts, the wildest flight of fancy
could never claim that your enclosure was intended for me.
However, if I cannot knit, I can write poems for you.
There are some on my desk now. But I will not send them
to you yet. They are very shy.</p>

<p>How is Peter?</p>

<p>Do I not write you from an incredible address, my friend?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Yesterday, the Event took place. It was my Red Letter Day,
illuminated with gold. Early in the afternoon, I was carried
out of the house, with comparatively little discomfort,
on a most ingenious stretcher, by Father and the Very Young
Doctor. My dear old Medicine Man was erect in the vanguard,
sternly repressing his excitement; while Sarah, visibly
jarred out of her usual self, brought up the rear in a flutter
of apron strings and ejaculated warnings. We must have
made an imposing procession. As long as I live&mdash;and I am
beginning to hope that it will be for half a century or more&mdash;I
shall never forget my first sense, after eleven years, of
being out in the open. Oh, I've had my windows wide to
the four winds, of course, and sunlight across my counterpane
and pillows. But how could that be the same? I
would have written you, but only one hour of Freedom was
granted me. The Family and the Medical Profession had
rigged and ready for me, between the two biggest, most
friendly trees on the lawn, a comfy and substantial hammock,
cushion-flanked. And so, for that hour, I lay and looked
and looked, over the hills and across the valleys, and right
into our own garden, which riots in bloom these August
days. I must confess that the disagreeable and youthful
doctor is an understanding person. After the first fifteen
minutes had passed in handshaking and congratulations and
solicitude, he marshalled my companions and led them away,
leaving me alone, in that heavenly air, with the green trees
singing all about me. I shall always feel more kindly toward
him for that strategic move. But however did the Creature
know that even dear Father was a little superfluous?</p>

<p>Will you tell your little Mother of my good fortune? I
know you both will be glad for me, but I can't believe anyone
can quite grasp my happiness, and my gratitude. Except perhaps,
a life prisoner who goes, unexpectedly,
free....</p>

<p>By the way, I had hardly been reluctantly settled in the
house again, before Father rushed out and wired that amiable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
go-between, our mutual friend John Denton. He is back in
New York again, as no doubt you know, and a return message
came from him today, announcing that he will be with
us in person on Friday, in order to "celebrate and to see
the miracle with his own eyes." Isn't that nice? And
won't your ears burn, distant Poet!</p>

<p>This is Monday. Sky-blue Monday. By Friday, perhaps,
I may be allowed to spend the whole afternoon in my
Green Playground.</p>

<p>Your friend, and so happily,</p>

<p>Princess!</p>

<p>Your letter is here, and so elated me that I put a black
cover over my chattering typewriter&mdash;it's <i>just</i> like a parrot,
you know,&mdash;and I must occasionally convince it, by artificial
means, that it is night&mdash;and left my cave dwelling
for the day, in order to fully share your holiday sense. And
when I returned, it was not alone. For what do you think?
Right in the wilds of Manhattan I found Somebody who
fairly begged to be sent to you! He goes to you by Mr.
John Denton, and by the time this reaches you I hope he will
feel himself very much at home. And I hope, too, that you
will care for his companionship. His name is, appropriately,
Wigglesworth. Please report to me on his arrival and subsequent
behavior.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diary, I'm out of Doors!</span></p>

<p class="p2 left65">August 28
</p>

<p>Diary, you're not to scold. I know I've not honored
you with so much as an exclamation point since my very
first out-of-doors entry. But Mr. John Denton has been
and gone&mdash;and Wigglesworth is here to stay! Let me
see how it all happened.</p>

<p>Friday last, at exactly three, Sarah arrayed me as a
lily of the field in a glorified turquoise and mauve neglig&eacute;e.
There were even mauve-and-gold pompomed slippers on
my worthless feet, and my newly washed hair was piled
high and transfixed with my Mother's tortoise-shell Spanish
comb. It was thus festively garbed that Father and
Doctor Bill&mdash;by which name he shall henceforth be
known, as some slight concession to his wizardry&mdash;settled
me happily under my particular trees, there to await
Mr. Denton's arrival. Sarah, at my insistence, smuggled
a mirror into my hand and sleeve, and when I heard the
smooth purr of the Denton motor, far up the road, I took
one little peek. For if I am not allowed to be just an
atom vain, what virtue is there in charming color schemes
and frothing chiffons? Certainly, the neglig&eacute;e is distractingly
pretty, and I am proud of Father's dress instinct.
And something or other had brought the faintest tinge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
color to my cheeks, the shadow of a sparkle to my eyes.
I was hoping that no one would detect me as I lay and
admired myself. But the Doctor Bill person did, of
course. He has eyes all over his head, that man! And
promptly, he settled a lovely rainbow cushion behind my
head, remarking very quietly,</p>

<p>"Perhaps this will heighten the effect, Miss Carroll!
Poor Uncle John!"</p>

<p>I could have killed him!</p>

<p>As it was, Diary, although I almost blush to confess
it, I&mdash;Well, as his disgustingly capable hand slid past my
cheek, I turned my head, ever so little, and, quite delicately,
I <i>bit</i>! Not hard, but in an extremely ladylike
manner. There was no occasion for his rude exclamation,
and the alarming brick-red which he proceeded to
turn. Happily for us both, for I was torn between insincere
apology and laughter, Mr. Denton arrived, engrossing
his nephew's attention and my own.</p>

<p>As usual he was accompanied by half a dozen baskets
of fruit and half a library shelf of the latest, lightest
books. Best of all, he brought his own rotund self&mdash;and
Wigglesworth!</p>

<p>I was prepared for something by Richard Warren's
letter, which had come to me Friday morning. But not
for this delicious bunch of black-satin, French bull puppy.
For Wigglesworth is the acme, the ultimate perfection of
dogdom. When, accompanied by gasps from all assembled,
he leaped at me out of the chauffeur's restraining
arms, I gave a perfectly healthy shriek, and clutched him,
chiffons notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"Where did you get him, Denton?" asked Father,
vainly endeavoring to part us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't get him," answered Mr. Denton, smiling.
"He was wished on me by an unknown admirer of
Mavis."</p>

<p>Father extricated Wigglesworth, and holding him
firmly&mdash;he has been well named&mdash;read aloud, from the
silver and leather collar which adorned his fascinating
neck, "Wigglesworth." Then, looking closer, added,
"What's this? 'Property of H.R.H.'?"</p>

<p>I am afraid I looked guilty. Dr. Denton whistled, and
stepped nearer the initials in question, or, shall I say, the
questionable initials?</p>

<p>I was annoyed to see in how friendly a spirit Wigglesworth
received the condescending medical hand upon his
quivering ears.</p>

<p>Father is anything but slow. And I have long since
let him into the secret of my romantic correspondence.</p>

<p>"So that's it," he began. And heaven alone knows
what he might have added had I not held up an imploring
hand.</p>

<p>Father, well-trained, subsided. But I didn't quite like
the little crease between his brows. It was Mr. Denton,
bless him, who saved the situation.</p>

<p>"Take me up to the house, Carroll," he said. "I
have half an acre of Connecticut soil on my person."
And off they went, arm in arm, with Mr. Denton casting a
reassuring look at me over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Alone with Dr. Bill and the frantic Wigglesworth,
"Well," I said, "isn't he wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked the obtuse creature.</p>

<p>I pointed to the puppy, chasing his tail with verve.</p>

<p>"Very," he answered drily. "Do you realize, Miss
Carroll, that you almost sat up?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>"When?" I shouted, very rudely, and quite disbelieving.</p>

<p>"About five minutes ago, when the dog jumped into
your hammock."</p>

<p>"But," I insisted childishly, "I haven't been able to sit
up all by myself since...."</p>

<p>"I know," he interrupted, "It's what you <i>have</i> done,
not what you haven't, that is the point. Try again."</p>

<p>Half crying from excitement, I tried. But it was no
use, and I sank back, helpless and hysterical.</p>

<p>"You see," I said sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He was looking at me out of those steel-blue eyes.</p>

<p>"We're not going to give up," he said. "But now you
must be taken back into the house again. You're tired."</p>

<p>And no amount of pleading or denial could bend his inflexible
will.</p>

<p>Wigglesworth came prancing into my room, just as the
Doctor was leaving.</p>

<p>"You haven't said how adorable he is," I said, coaxing
my new toy to the bed.</p>

<p>"Adorable!" he repeated, emphatically.</p>

<p>But, Diary-dear, the Doctor wasn't looking at the <i>dog</i>!</p>

August 30th</p>

<p>Dear Poet:</p>

<p>By now Mr. Denton has brought you my incoherent note
of thanks for the benison of Wigglesworth. Every day I
thank you more. He is the dearest little friend one could
imagine or wish for. I have taught him to bark loudly
when I say your name, and I hope to bring him to an appreciation
of poetry, by selected readings! Next week,
sometime, I am to have my promised lawn fete to introduce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the countryside to the new member of our household. Even
Sarah has succumbed. I heard her talking something suspiciously
like baby-talk to him this morning, when she came
in with my tray and observed Wiggles regarding her brightly
and wagging all over, from his basket at the foot of my
bed. And Father is a willing captive of his charms, even
luring him from me on long, companionable walks. But I
believe that he is jealous of you because he has never thought
of getting me a dog. I have had birds and goldfish and
even an Angora kitten which lived but to run away. But
never since childhood a real live dog of my own. Mr. Denton
must have worked some magic with Father that he has
so inexplicably allowed me to accept so valuable a gift from&mdash;a
stranger? But no, I cannot call you that!</p>

<p>I regret to report that Wigglesworth has conceived an
adoration for the doctor. The one of no consequence, I
mean. I cannot understand it, but there seems to be a
natural affinity between the two.</p>

<p>Later, I must write you all the things, or, anyway, almost
all, which Mr. Denton said about you. For of course we
had a little session behind closed doors, and I asked the
poor man questions until his grey head rang. Aren't you
curious? But before I repeat to you what was, of course,
told to me in strictest confidence, I must ask you <i>if those
things are true</i>.</p>

<p>Wigglesworth sends his love. He is beside my bed, this
minute, on the floor, holding up one paw in greeting.</p>

<p class="left50">
Very gratefully yours,<br />

September 5</p>

<p>Dear Diary, I'm sorry that I neglect you so. But you
see, with friends calling every day to behold me, royally
at home out of doors, and with a week's preparation for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
my "Come one, come all" tea, which took place yesterday
afternoon, and with almost daily letters from Richard
Warren to answer&mdash;I've so many now that they make
far too bulky a book of you and so I have them tied up
with ribbon, under my pillow&mdash;and with Peter's recent
heroic attempt to drink gasoline, and Wigglesworth's
brilliant development as a bloodhound&mdash;well, I have
had but little time for you, Blue Book.</p>

<p>Today, Father is out and Sarah busy below stairs. It
is five o'clock of a golden September afternoon, and I am
alone, and ready to record the events of the past week.
Suppose we begin with Peter, who lives next door, as you
very well know, and who is an active and ambitious and
altogether charming seven-year old. It seems, Diary, that
Peter has, during the summer, become hopelessly enamored
of Jimmy Simpson, the ten-year old brother of
Sammy, a feckless towhead, tanned as a saddle and
twice as tough! From my windows, and more recently
also from the nearer vantage point of my hammock, I have
observed the progress of their friendship, dating from the
early days of summer when Jimmy condescended to aid
his older brother in the morning delivery of the Simpson
milk. Lately, Jimmy has been seen displaying his ragged
blue overalls about the lawn adjoining ours. I have
heard, too, blood-curdling shrieks and dire groans which
I take to portend that Peter has more than once inveigled
Jimmy into his own favorite and histrionic pastime of
"Injuns and Tigers." Once, Jimmy in his role of scalper
became slightly too realistic, and Peter, bursting through
the hedge which separates the Goodrich property from
ours, fled to me for protection. With his curly head on
my breast, I turned against the aggressor.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Simpson," I cried indignantly, "aren't you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
ashamed to frighten a boy younger than yourself? Don't
you know that isn't manly?"</p>

<p>Jimmy, engaging, brazen, and blue-eyed, stubbed one
bare toe against the grass.</p>

<p>"Honest, Miss Mavis," he defended himself firmly,
"I didn't hurt him none. He's a <i>baby</i>, he is!" he concluded,
with a positively vicious glance at the back of
Peter's head.</p>

<p>"I'm not!" shouted the accused, rising up in honest
wrath.</p>

<p>"Y'are," repeated Jimmy. "Baby an' telltale."</p>

<p>Here Peter, to my infinite delight, squared two small
brown fists, and disengaging himself from my restraining
hands, advanced belligerently upon his idol.</p>

<p>"You Jimmy," said Peter. "You take that back&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>I swear I saw a gleam of admiration in the Simpson
eye.</p>

<p>"Yes," I begged hastily, "do take it back, Jimmy."</p>

<p>Jimmy shifted uneasily upon his capacious feet.</p>

<p>"Well," he began uncertainly. And then a wholly
friendly smile irradiated his freckled face. "I was only
funning, Peter," he said generously.</p>

<p>I breathed again. Peter dropped his hands to his sides
and said happily, "Got any cookies for us, Mavis?"</p>

<p>I rang my silver bell for Sarah, and presently she appeared
from the kitchen, greeted Jimmy in none too
friendly accents, and disappearing into her domain returned
again with a heaped plate of crisp tan cookies and
three glasses of lemonade.</p>

<p>"There," said Sarah, grudgingly, "you young limbs!"</p>

<p>She looked at my two small friends as she spoke, but
I am afraid she included me in her remark.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>This incident served to show Jimmy the mettle of my
seven year old neighbor. It was by way of a delicate
tribute to Peter that he was asked, on the following day,
to be one of six competitors in a foot race which, starting
from his own gate, was to end at the cross roads some
five hundred yards distant. Just before the start he
came over and exhibited himself to me, clad in vest and
drawers, with sneakers on his little feet and a huge red 5
decorating his visibly inflated chest.</p>

<p>Solemnly, I shook his hand and wished him well. Then
I lay back in my hammock to await the result of the
race.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Peter, very red in the face, very
hot, and manfully trying to suppress his tears, appeared
through the gap in the hedge, with Jimmy in close attendance.</p>

<p>"He won!" said Peter, disconsolately, pointing a dusty
forefinger at his companion.</p>

<p>"But Pete came in second," hastily put in the victor,
standing at the foot of my swinging couch.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wanted to win," announced Peter, the uncomforted.
Then, seeing my eyes fixed in affection and condolence
on him, he gave one loud frantic gulp and came
into my arms.</p>

<p>"But, Peter darling," I, said to the one small red ear
I could see, "you must remember that you are only seven
if you <i>are</i> big for your age, and all the other boys are
much older, aren't they, Jimmy?" I asked this with my
most appealing look over Peter's bowed head toward the
Simpson scion.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Mavis, ma'am," corroborated Jimmie
loudly. "An' Pete, he done awful good to come in second.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Why, Josh Watkins was in the race too, and he's
eleven an' a terrible swift runner."</p>

<p>"You see?" I said to the Ear.</p>

<p>Peter raised his head and thrust his grimy fists into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he said bravely, "only...."</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," I begged, "next time you'll come
in first, won't he, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" agreed Jimmy heartily. And Peter, content
with the confidence of his vanquisher, presently made off
with him, saying earnestly, "But Jimmy, what makes you
go so fast?"</p>

<p>Two days later, swinging lazily between my trees and
reading <i>The Lyric Hour</i> to Wiggles, who listened attentively
and with cocked, inquiring ears, I was horrified to
see Mrs. Goodrich hurtle herself through the hedge, followed
by Loretta, her black cook, both of them wringing
their hands&mdash;Loretta, I swear, almost as white as her
mistress&mdash;and both demanding,</p>

<p>"<i>Have</i> you seen Peter?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," I answered, "not today. Why?"</p>

<p>Sarah, her sixth sense telling her that something was
wrong, appeared simultaneously at the foot of my hammock.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mavis," said Peter's pretty mother, "he's lost!
He's been gone two hours, and we've been everywhere!"</p>

<p>Loretta, her apron over her kinky head, rocked to and
fro.</p>

<p>I looked at Sarah.</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?" I asked, my heart standing
very still.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Mavis."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>Except for the sound of Loretta's noisy weeping, we
were quite quiet.</p>

<p>"<i>The Black Pond!</i>" said Mrs. Goodrich, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Don't!" said Sarah and I together.</p>

<p>For the Black Pond, Diary, up the road, is a wicked
sheet of water, depthless and sinister.</p>

<p>I have never cursed my helplessness as I did then.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Jimmy Simpson...." I began. But Mrs.
Goodrich interrupted me.</p>

<p>"Loretta has been to the Simpsons', Mavis. Jimmy
is off with Sammy somewhere. No one has seen or heard
of Peter since this morning. And we have not seen him
since luncheon."</p>

<p>"Where's Father?" I asked, looking at Sarah.</p>

<p>"Somewhere's with Doctor Denton," she answered.
And as she did so, a gay whistle reached me from the
direction of our gate.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's Father now." I said hopefully. But
it was only Doctor Bill, hatless, coatless, swinging up the
path and cutting across to us.</p>

<p>"Miss Carroll," he said smiling, "your father asked
me to tell you...." and then, "Why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>He looked from one to the other, and it was Sarah
who answered.</p>

<p>"It's Peter, Doctor. He's lost."</p>

<p>"Lost! Nonsense. He couldn't get lost here. Every
one in Green Hill knows the little chap. Where have you
looked?" he asked Mrs. Goodrich.</p>

<p>"Everywhere. And telephoned every house for miles.
His father is in town, you know. Oh...." she broke off
incoherently, "I can never forgive myself&mdash;my baby&mdash;"</p>

<p>The doctor's hand was on her, quieting, soothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"Mustn't break down, Mrs. Goodrich. Suppose you
sit here for a bit with Miss Carroll and get your breath.
We'll find the boy, won't we, Wiggles?" The dog
jumped at the sound of his name in the beloved voice, and
began chasing his tail in an ecstasy of showing off.</p>

<p>Dr. Denton beckoned Sarah, spoke to her in a low
voice, and I heard her answer, "Yes sir," before she left
the group and went toward the house, taking Loretta with
her.</p>

<p>"Who saw him last?" asked the doctor cheerfully,
sitting down with Wiggles on his knee.</p>

<p>"Michel, our chauffeur. Peter was with him in the
barn right after lunch."</p>

<p>"And where is Michel now?"</p>

<p>"He went with several of the men on the place to
search," said Mrs. Goodrich. "I think&mdash;they didn't
tell me, but I think they mean to drag the pond&mdash;" She
went to pieces there. But it was only for a moment, for
Sarah appeared again, with a glass of something. Dr.
Benton took it from her.</p>

<p>"Drink this," he said quietly, his hand on Mrs. Goodrich's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Watching him, I suddenly knew that it would be all
right; that Peter was not really lost, but only mislaid; that
we would all be spared a cruel and terrible sorrow. He
seemed to read my mind, for he nodded at me and said,
smiling, "That's better, Miss Carroll."</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that the man is really a magician.</p>

<p>It was perhaps ten minutes later that Michel appeared
through the hedge. Mrs. Goodrich, rather dangerously
calm, I thought, got to her feet.</p>

<p>"Well?" she breathed.</p>

<p>The chauffeur shook his head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"No trace, ma'am. The boys are still looking...."</p>

<p>"The Black Pond...?" she asked, in a whisper, one
hand at her throat.</p>

<p>"They're down there now."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>She was at Dr. Denton's side now, her hands on his
arm. "Please help us." Her eyes sought his.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do my best," he answered. "Michel,
did Peter say anything to you in the barn about going out
to play?"</p>

<p>The Irishman's face corrugated in an effort to remember.</p>

<p>"No, doctor, sor. Not that I mind. He came out, the
lad, to ask me what makes cars go fast."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>It was I who spoke. The foot race of two days before
flashed suddenly into my mind, and the last thing I had
heard Peter say, "But Jimmy, what makes you go so
fast?"</p>

<p>"What did you tell him?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well," Michel scratched his red head, "I told him
the gasoline, Miss Mavis, just to keep him quiet."</p>

<p>In a word I told the others about the race and Peter's
disappointment. "You don't suppose," I finished, hesitating,
"that he tried to...."</p>

<p>"Drink gasoline?" concluded Dr. Benton thoughtfully.</p>

<p>We all looked at Michel.</p>

<p>"Well," he said slowly, "seems to me that I did see
him foolin' around the tank. But I was busy, and when
I looked up again, he was gone."</p>

<p>"I seen him runnin'," interposed Loretta suddenly.
"Runnin' down toward the gate. I remember now!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"Gasoline!" said Peter's mother pitifully, "Would
... would it <i>kill</i> him, Doctor?"</p>

<p>The doctor laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Not by a long shot," he answered cheerfully. "And
if he did take a drink of it, I'll wager it wasn't a very
long drink. Now, Mrs. Goodrich, you and Loretta go
home, and get some water heated, and fetch out a pot
of mustard. I'm off with Wiggles to find the young
athlete."</p>

<p>And that's all, Diary, except that they did find him. It
was Wiggles, really, who discovered him in a deserted
barn half a mile up the road, sleeping peacefully and
smelling to high heaven of the gas. Home they brought
him, and it must go on record that though mustard and
warm water had no effect whatsoever upon that cast iron
little stomach, every time Peter coughed Dr. Denton
swears that the gasoline fumes nearly knocked him over!</p>

<p>"Did you really drink it, sweetheart?" asked his
mother just before she tucked him in bed.</p>

<p>"Course," answered Peter, wide-eyed. "Mike said
it made the cars go fast, so I tried it. I didn't like it
much," he confessed, "but golly, how I ran! I wish
Jimmy could have seen me!"</p>

<p>And on that, Peter fell asleep.</p>

<p>Diary, I am nearly asleep too. Won't Sarah scold if
she catches me! So I will postpone till tomorrow my account
of the Lawn Tea&mdash;and&mdash;the Utterly New Man
imminent in our midst!</p>

<p>Now, aren't you curious?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER V</p>

<p class="left65 p2">
The Very Next Day</p>

<p>I was so tired last night, Diary, that I couldn't sleep,
and Sarah blames you! She has just said, sternly, "No
more writing, Miss Mavis," and vanished from the room.
Out you come, from under my pillow, in lawless defiance
of the mandate. For it's raining and dull, and I can't go
out of doors, and so I must have something to occupy
me, must I not? But isn't it perfectly wonderful that
the rain should deprive me of something? For, it was
only a very short time ago that rain or sunshine meant
very little to me, aside from aesthetic pleasure, and shut
or open windows as the case might be! Now for a description
of the Lawn Fete!</p>

<p>It was an early affair; three o'clock, to be exact. And
very young September put on her very gayest appearance
for me. Father and Sarah, Dr. Bill and Dr. Mac, constituted
themselves a Committee on Decoration and Refreshments,
and as a consequence we had a lawn gay with
wicker chairs, hammocks, cushions, tables, flags, and
flowers; and a very important table loaded with sandwiches,
tiny cakes, bonbons, and all manner of cool drinkables.
And&mdash;then came the crowds! I do believe everyone
in Green Hill turned out, from Sammy and his Rosie-of-the-Telegraph
(I wonder what happened to the messages
during that afternoon? Never mind! No one
would have been home to receive them!), to Peter and his
small friends and old Granny Wallace, who drove up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
a dilapidated buggy, and wore a new black bonnet for the
occasion. I wore&mdash;and this will interest you&mdash;the
mauve and turquoise neglig&eacute;e, with various additions.
One was a bunch of the loveliest, glowingest orchids you
have ever seen, which was brought to me by Mr. John
Denton, who made a flying half-hour's return trip for
the express purpose, he said, of kissing my hands and
delivering the flowers, which he assured me came from
the donor of Wiggles. A card with the orchids read,
"To match a delightful costume." So Mr. Denton, the
villain, has been talking! Under my laces, I wore Richard
Warren's jade lucky-piece, and in honor of the occasion
I decorated Wiggles, much to his disgust, with a
huge purple bow. It was very becoming to his lively and
brunette beauty, as all who saw him will attest.</p>

<p>It was a dear afternoon. Everyone was so happy for
me. They fairly overwhelmed me with good wishes and
affectionate, optimistic prophecies. My two medicos kept
a very stern guard over me. It seemed as if I couldn't
get rid of one or the other for more than a moment at a
time. But I had Dr. Mac in a perfectly beautiful rage
by accusing him of trying to steal the Scandinavian heart
of Hildeborg, my massive masseuse. Oh yes, she was
there too, marvellously gotten up, her yellow head very
much in the foreground and her big voice booming out at
the most inopportune moments in more than the most inopportune
remarks, thereby greatly endangering the preservation
of gravity in those present. Her public advice
to Dr. Mac, along lines of reduction, was extremely exhilarating!</p>

<p>We had music, rendered slightly off key, but with all
the good will in the world, by the Green Hill Musical
Four, consisting of a Simpson, a Watkins, and the Jones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
twins, who performed respectively upon a cornet, a violin,
a banjo, and a mouth-organ. It was, Diary, the very
last word in successful parties. Only one thing occurred
to cast any shadow over a wonderful day. And, of all
people selected by an unkind Fate to sully my happiness,
it was Peter who, to mix metaphors somewhat, cast the
first stone. In the presence of at least six villagers, including
Granny Wallace, the town gossip, he regarded my
frivolity of a lace and ribbon cap, and asked, as solemnly
as a mouth full to capacity with cake would permit,
"Mavis, <i>how</i> do you set your cap?"</p>

<p>"How do I what?" I asked in all innocence, one hand
to my headgear.</p>

<p>"Set it," he repeated. "Sally says that Adeline says
that you are setting your cap for Doctor Denton!"</p>

<p>Adeline, Diary, is Sally's sister, and Dr. Denton's cook.</p>

<p>Several in the group about me laughed, and Granny
Wallace's ears grew visibly in length.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what you mean, Peterkins," I answered
with well-assumed carelessness, and turned to talk
volubly with Mrs. Goodrich, who was adding to the gaiety
by saying audibly, "Hush, Peter!"</p>

<p>But Peter was not to be silenced.</p>

<p>"Sally says," he protested, in his clear little voice,
"that Adeline says she told doctor Denton about it, your
cap, you know, and that he laughed out loud and said you
could for all of him!"</p>

<p>"What's that about Doctor Denton?" asked that individual,
suddenly coming up quietly behind the group.</p>

<p>Talk about bombshells!</p>

<p>Despite Mrs. Goodrich's frantic attempt to hush her
young hopeful, Peter, his hand in Doctor Denton's, obligingly
repeated his story.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>"An'," he concluded, turning to me wistfully, "please,
Mavis, won't you set it for me? I'd like to see how you
do it!"</p>

<p>Amid an awestruck silence, Doctor Denton swung
Peter, who squealed with delight, up and up to his broad
shoulder, and said, laughing but a little red,</p>

<p>"Nonsense, old chap, Miss Carroll won't set her cap
for you for&mdash;well, about twenty years, more or less.
But isn't it a pretty cap?" With a wicked laugh he
turned and strode off, Peter clinging to his shock of dark
hair and asking very loudly, "But does she do it like
hens do, Doctor Uncle?"</p>

<p>I haven't the remotest idea what happened after that.
I vaguely remember Granny Wallace hurrying and cackling
off, and the other members of the group trying to
compose their features and to re-order their conversation.
That Mrs. Goodrich, before she left, bent over me and
whispered, "Mavis dear, I'm <i>so</i> sorry!" helped matters,
as far as I was concerned, not one whit. By the same
evening, I am certain that the story was all over Green
Hill. Even Sarah said something to me, before I went to
bed....</p>

<p>Somehow, I should have thought my helplessness would
have protected me a little....</p>

<p>After my guests had gone, Doctor Denton appeared on
the scene.</p>

<p>"MacAllister and I will carry you up to your room
now, Miss Carroll," he said cheerily.</p>

<p>I felt very tired, very cross, and behaved, I'm afraid,
like a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>"If you'll get Doctor Mac and Father...."</p>

<p>He went quite white.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said stiffly, and turned away. I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
not see him again that day, or for several days thereafter.</p>

<p>I wonder if he really said that I "could for all of
him?"</p>

<p>Do you think it kind of Your Royal Benevolence to write
me the most charming note in the world to thank me for my
flowers, and then to almost ruin it by a postscript, a scolding&mdash;dare
I say, nagging&mdash;postscript, in which you sternly
forbid me to give myself pleasure and send you "anything
more, ever"! You are an&mdash;an Indian <i>Receiver</i>, that's
what you are! And I refuse to have any dealings with your
postscript! I will separate it carefully from the rest of the
letter, and consign it to candle flame.</p>

<p>I am glad you enjoyed your lawn party. Sorry, though,
that anything should have happened during your At Home
day to disturb you. Although you do not tell me what it
was, I have put two and two together, made a hundred and
six, and deducted that some member of my blundering and
heavy-footed sex stepped upon your sensibilities. But I am
sure you have forgiven him by now&mdash;although far be it from
me to hold any brief for an unknown and hated rival!</p>

<p>Please, may I come to your next party? I am sure my
mother would be willing to chaperone me. I forwarded her
your last note; it was addressed to her and I did not dare keep
it. But I read it (yes, I did) and I do not notice that you
scolded her about those rose-grey bed socks! Indeed, you
seemed very glad to have them. She has been fretting, I
know, that they were not finished sooner, but she was called
away, as no doubt she told you in her letter, by an illness
in the family.

<p>My respects to Wiggles. I wonder if he is entirely cognizant

<p>The New Young Man has arrived in our village. An
embarrassment of riches! He is a college friend of that
Doctor Person, a painter and a poet as well! I have
graciously given my consent that he be brought to call. I
wonder what he looks like? Not like his name, I hope,
which is Penny! Father just came upstairs, and asked
me if I would be ready to see Dr. Denton in fifteen minutes.
He looked quite funny when he said it, and seemed
so ill at ease. I can't imagine.... Well, Diary, although
the Doctor doesn't deserve it, I fancy I shall call
Sarah and tell her to get me the rose-and-grey bed jacket
which is so becoming&mdash;to my room!</p>

<p class="p2 left65">
Three Hours Later</p>

<p>Diary, it's not possible! I can't believe it! I've been
here half an hour alone, trying to realize all that it will
mean to me, and trying to collect my thoughts. Fifteen
minutes to the second after Father spoke to me about this
impending and oddly formal visit of the Doctor's, he
ushered that gentleman into the room, placed a low chair
for him by the bed, and then, taking my hands, said very
gravely, "Mavis, Dr. Denton wants to talk to you for a
little while. He has something which he is very anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
to persuade you to do. I have told him that, without your
consent, it is impossible. You know that I will never
force you to anything. But will you listen to him, dear,
and for all our sakes try to say 'Yes'?" As if he had
to plead with me, my father, for whom I would do anything
in the world!</p>

<p>Since the day I was brought home, broken, I have never
seen my Father so moved. More out of nervousness
than anything else, I said, "Daddy, it sounds like a proposal!"</p>

<p>The minute I said it I was sorry&mdash;and glad. For
although Father laughed, Dr. Denton looked perfectly
furious! It must be painful to turn the color he does&mdash;like
a&mdash;a chameleon.</p>

<p>Then Father kissed me. Under his breath I heard him
say, "God bless my Mavis!" and in a moment I was
alone with the enemy.</p>

<p>The steel-blue eyes regarded me for a full moment, and
then, almost sternly, he spoke.</p>

<p>"Miss Carroll," he said, "with your permission, and
with your help, without which we can do nothing, we
are going to ask you to make a series of efforts: first, to
sit erect unaided; then, to stand; and, by slow degrees, to
walk."</p>

<p>There was something so confident in his tone! Perhaps
he might have gone on, but I flung out both hands
to him, and he waited.</p>

<p>"Doctor!" I cried, "Doctor&mdash;it isn't possible! I
have tried! They made me try at first, and it nearly
killed me. Don't make me," I begged childishly; "don't
make me go through all that horror again!"</p>

<p>"There will be no horror," he said deliberately.
"There will be pain&mdash;yes&mdash;but comparatively slight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
All through the summer I have watched your case. Little
by little we have stimulated the unused muscles, as you
have gained in vitality. At the time following your accident,
it was naturally torture to you to be forced to
submit to the hands of doctors and nurses. But eleven
years have gone by, and I am convinced, and have convinced
both our good friend MacAllister and your father,
that the injury to your back has long since healed,
and that nothing remains but the inflexibility of the
muscles and, if I may term it such, a type of mental
paralysis."</p>

<p>"You mean...." I began, not yet believing.</p>

<p>"I mean," he interrupted, "that your mind has persuaded
your body that it will never walk again. Now, <i>I</i>
know better. Yours is not the first case of this sort
which has been brought to my attention. I have seen
six cures out of eight such cases during my studies abroad.
They interested me very much. It was primarily your
case that brought me to Green Hill. And the cure&mdash;please
believe me&mdash;rests entirely with you."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" I said flatly, staring at him.
"It simply isn't possible that half a hundred doctors have
been mistaken." And my eyes, although my tongue did
not, said very plainly, "And who are you?"</p>

<p>For the first time, he smiled.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said, "if I have been unable to inspire
you with so little confidence. The 'half a hundred'
doctors were probably quite correct&mdash;at the time
they had your case. How long has it been since you have
had a specialist?"</p>

<p>"Six&mdash;no, seven years," I answered, and shuddered.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he said. And then, very suddenly,
"Miss Carroll, do you <i>want</i> to walk again? Do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
want to be a normal, active girl, instead of a semi-invalid?"</p>

<p>I hated his tone.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," I fairly shouted, "do&mdash;do you
think I'm a fool?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," answered the amazing creature, calmly.</p>

<p>I was too angry to speak.</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss Carroll," he said quietly, "let's get
down to brass tacks. For eleven years you have lain on
your back, allowing yourself to be waited on, coddled,
wrapped in cotton wool. You have had the companionship
of your father, who is the finest man in the world,
but whose whole life is wrapped up in you, and who has
sacrificed that life to your whims and your desires. Your
father was never meant to be buried down here; not with
that personality and fine brain. Think of the doors which
should be open to him and which your illness has closed,&mdash;travel,
society, the exploration of places and people,
instead of a rather pretty, very narrow, Connecticut <i>rut</i>!
You have had Sarah&mdash;sentimental to a degree under a
rocky exterior, ready and anxious to work her fingers to
the bone to please you. You have had an entire village
at your beck and call; have dispensed justice and advice
from your bed like Royalty; and you have thrived on it,
my dear lady, thrived on the adoration and the sacrifice,
and on your own martyrdom. Now, I am here solely to
give you a chance to repay your father and all the others
for their love and care and coddling. Do you realize that
your father is a comparatively young man? That, by
tying him to your bedside you have narrowed his life
down until it consists of this room, this house, this tiny
village? It's up to you to give something to your father.
It may cost you pain. But I wonder if you have any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
idea of what you have cost him in heartache? Are you
willing to make the effort, if only for his sake?"</p>

<p>No one in all my life had ever spoken to me like that!
I was so hurt, so outraged, so bewildered, it seemed as if
I just couldn't live a minute longer, with that cool, cutting
voice in my ears.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;brute!" I said, choking, "It's not fair!
Do you mean to tell me that I am selfish and unkind?
That I don't love my father? That I am a useless, worthless
hypochondriac?"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I wouldn't put it quite so strongly," he suggested
courteously.</p>

<p>I shut my hands hard under the bedclothes and held my
head very high.</p>

<p>"Very well," I told him, rather viciously, "I will do
all you say, if Father and Doctor MacAllister are agreed."</p>

<p>I could feel the red spots burning on my cheeks. And
in my mind I was saying, over and over, like a child,
"I'll show you! <i>I'll show you!</i>" I think I almost
hoped I should die&mdash;just to make him sorry. And it
was so hard to keep the tears back. I wouldn't cry. I
<i>wouldn't</i>.</p>

<p>I cried.</p>

<p>Suddenly, his arm was around me, and his voice, so
changed, so immeasurably gentle, was saying, very close,</p>

<p>"You poor little kid!"</p>

<p>"I hate you!" I said, at that.</p>

<p>The arm tightened; then dropped. Dr. Denton rose.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said, heartily, towering above me.
"That's something to work on! Well, I have your promise,
and for love of your father and hate of me you'll walk
yet, before the winter. And now, I will send Sarah to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
you with something to quiet those&mdash;outraged feelings.
Tomorrow we'll begin the treatment."</p>

<p>Then he left the room.</p>

<p>And that's all Diary. I had a talk with Father. I
can't set it down here. It was too beautiful and too intimate.
But now that I realize all that it has meant, this
long illness of mine, and all that my recovery might mean
to him, I am willing to undergo any torture, any agony;
willing even to endure the Cruel Magician and his Black
Magic.</p>

<p>How I hate him, Diary! It makes me feel quite strong
to hate anyone so,&mdash;I, who have always cared for people,
and lived on their love.</p>

<p>What have I just written ... "lived on their
love"...? I wonder if he is right, if I have taken
everything, and given nothing in return?</p>

<p>Tonight, with my mind and soul in chaos, I wish more
than ever that my Mother had lived.</p>

<p>Dear Diary, silent and loyal confidant, wish me well for
tomorrow!</p>

<p class="left65 p2">
<span class="smcap">Green Hill</span><br />
September 22</p>

<p>Yesterday, Diary, was the most exhausting day I have
ever survived! An alternate succession of massage and
naps, and naps and massage! And two efforts to sit up!
The first was quite unsuccessful. I was trembling all
over with excitement, and perhaps fear. And at the very
first attempt, fear of pain and the immediate succeeding
pain itself, absolutely unnerved me. Dr. Mac, standing
close beside the bed, looked across at his colleague. He
didn't shake his head, but the expression in his keen old
eyes was equivalent. Dr. Denton frowned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you try again, in a few minutes, Miss Carroll?"
he asked, ignoring Dr. Mac, and the little hurt, despairing
sound which I couldn't help making.</p>

<p>"I can't!" I said flatly.</p>

<p>He spread out his hands in an entirely foreign gesture
of defeat.</p>

<p>"Of course, if you prefer not...." he suggested
sketchily.</p>

<p>There was something so positively scornful in the look
he bent on me that I writhed. I made my two eyes as
much like swords as possible&mdash;I hope, Diary, that they
were not crossed!&mdash;and snapped, "Do you mean to
imply...?"</p>

<p>Suddenly I stopped. I was looking straight into the
steel-blue eyes, and it was not until I saw their frosty
expression change to something distinctly like triumph
that I discovered that&mdash;<i>I was sitting up!</i></p>

<p>Actually! But only for the fraction of a minute. It
was the discovery itself, I think, that laid me flat again,
with Dr. Mac's arm around me, and his disengaged hand
stretched across the bed, frantically shaking Dr. Denton's.</p>

<p>"Laddie, 'tis mar-r-vellous!" he was saying, with a
remarkable rolling of his r's.</p>

<p>But Dr. Denton was looking at me.</p>

<p>"You see," he said quietly, "that after all you <i>can</i>
do it. It is only a matter of patience, and the will
to conquer. And perhaps a certain amount of&mdash;impetus."</p>

<p>He was smiling, quite flushed, his eyes more brilliant
than I had ever seen them.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "suppose I go down and tell your
father. He has been walking the floor ever since we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
came up, I know. We won't bother you again today,
Miss Carroll. But tomorrow you're going to be perfectly
amazed to see how easy it will be to repeat the
performance."</p>

<p>After he had gone, Dr. Mac walked around my little
room, loquacious for once in his life.</p>

<p>"Isn't he a wonder?" he kept asking me. "Lassie,
it's worth living for just to meet a man like that. The
born healer," he kept saying over and over, "the born
healer!"</p>

<p>"I've no doubt," I said politely, "that Dr. Denton is a
very able physician."</p>

<p>Dr. Mac stopped in his tracks, so suddenly that he
nearly fell over.</p>

<p>"What's this? What's this?" he said, his bushy eyebrows
drawn down over his eyes, so closely that I could
not see their expression.</p>

<p>I repeated my remark.</p>

<p>One piercing glance, the suspicion of a twinkle, a deep,
disconcerting chuckle. And then my old friend said
cryptically,</p>

<p>"So that's the way the land lies, little Mavis!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I began, irritably. I seem
to be in a continual state of annoyance these days,
Diary.</p>

<p>But he had gone, and all the way downstairs I could
hear him chuckling.</p>

<p>Even my succeeding little thanksgiving talk with Father
failed to put me in a good humor again.</p>

<p>I think Doctor Mac is horrid!</p>

<p>But if I am cured, Diary, won't I make them <i>all</i> "sit
up!"

<p>Dear Poet:</p>

<p>Certainly not! But when one is slowly and forcibly being
resurrected, one has little time for letter writing. Shall I
tell you the program which has been laid out for me? But
first of all, I must tell you that I am actually able to sit up
for a few moments each day. And after I grow stronger
and more daring, a chair is to be substituted for my bed,
and then a wheel chair; and maybe after that a real live
automobile! And finally, so I have been promised, I am to
learn to walk! Fancy being such a baby! But this very
morning, the Biggest, most Expensive, Busiest Specialist in
the country&mdash;who knew me eleven years ago when he was
not quite so big or expensive or busy&mdash;came to our little
house, and after a prolonged Examination told us that there
was no reason on earth why I should not recover wholly and
absolutely. It will take time, he said, but it is certain.
And I need undergo no knife, or painful treatment. I am
only to mind, and not be in too great a hurry.</p>

<p>I feel as if, link by link, the fetters were falling. I hardly
dare think ahead&mdash;to the day when the great round world
shall be mine again. To the day when I shall go to all the
places I only know from books and pictures. I want to go
to the theatre. I want to see a horse race! I want to sail
in a boat! And I want to walk and walk and walk! And,
Poet, I want to fly!</p>

<p>I must never be very athletic, they say. Probably I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
never ride or skate, or even drive a car! I don't know&mdash;it
doesn't matter, of course. But I do hope that I may
dance! I've dreamed of dancing. You know, in my dreams,
I am always strong and well.</p>

<p>You are happy with me and for me, I am sure. And
sometimes I think that your letters and your friendship have
given me courage and faith which otherwise I should not
have had. It must be a beautiful world, and life must be
a wonderful thing, if poets can live and make us see beauty
through their clear eyes.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to you. And all through the perils and
adventures of being reborn, I shall be glad to feel that you
are thinking of me, and holding your thumbs. Will you,
please?</p>

<p>Do you know a painter-poet named Penny? At least,
that is his real name. He writes under a slightly more
suitable cognomen, but I have been unable, in our brief acquaintance,
to drag it from him. He seems a very nice person
indeed, and made a long call on me this morning.</p>

September 25</p>

<p>Diary, Dr. Denton brought the Penny-man to see me
today. Perhaps as a flesh-and-blood flag of truce. At all
events, it was more than an amusing experience. I was
out-of-doors, propped up in my now very ambitious position,
feeding Wiggles tea biscuits, and reading <i>The Lyric
Hour</i> for the millionth time. When the two men appeared,
I was declaiming aloud, slightly drunk by the
most marvellously blue-hazy day, and feeling tremendously
strong and happy. After the introductions,</p>

<p>"I've brought you good medicine, Miss Carroll," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Dr. Denton, indicating his embarrassed friend. "A real
live poet! The only one in captivity! Eats out of the
hand. But&mdash;I warn you he is modest. The proverbial
violet is brazen compared to Wright. And he won't
lionize worth a nickel, and I am sworn to silence concerning
his prowess with the pen, and even his nom-de-guerre."</p>

<p>Mr. Penny&mdash;isn't it a dreadful name!&mdash;and combined
with Wright, too!&mdash;sat down limply in the chair
beside me.</p>

<p>"Please," he said, pleasantly and plaintively, "don't
pay any attention to him."</p>

<p>"I never do," I said in my sugariest tones.</p>

<p>Dr. Denton lowered his inches to the ground, and there,
sprawled like a starfish, regarded me brightly.</p>

<p>"She's truthful," he assured his friend. "She never
does. And you've no idea how she dislikes me. That
handicaps you at the start, Wright, old fellow. Doesn't
it, Miss Carroll?"</p>

<p>I considered Mr. Penny's amiable, blonde countenance
judicially.</p>

<p>"It might," I agreed.</p>

<p>"You see?" This from the Creature in a piercing
stage whisper.</p>

<p>"But it doesn't!" I finished, smiling brilliantly at
Mr. Penny, who appeared slightly confused.</p>

<p>Catching at a straw, which happened to be the beloved
<i>Lyric Hour</i>, the Unknown&mdash;I simply can't call him
Penny all the time&mdash;it's too ridiculous!&mdash;picked up the
book, which was lying beside me, and immediately gave
the most theatrical start I have ever seen. I've never
seen plays, of course, but I have read them, and know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
stage directions when I see them in the flesh. This was
a particularly good example of "confronted with the tell-tale
revolver, Sebastian starts violently...."</p>

<p>"Richard Warren," read the Stranger aloud, with a
very poor affectation of indifference.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "do you know him?"</p>

<p>The Penny turned a beautiful crimson.</p>

<p>"I've read the book," he faltered.</p>

<p>My back may be weak, but my eyes are good.
And the glance that passed between Dr. Denton and his
friend did not escape me.</p>

<p>"It's nothing to be ashamed of, old man," said the
former soothingly, "particularly as it appears to be Miss
Carroll's chief literary diet."</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked my guest, rather excitedly, I thought.</p>

<p>"I adore it!" I answered, with all the schoolgirl fervor
I could muster. And it rang true, Diary, for it is!</p>

<p>Dr. Denton looked at me keenly.</p>

<p>"Lucky book!" he said lightly, while Mr. Penny added
almost under his breath,</p>

<p>"Lucky author!"</p>

<p>He has nice, doggie, brown eyes, and very fair hair.
I smiled into the former and longed to stroke the latter;
it was so very smooth and shining.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me about your own work?" I asked,
beguilingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, do," urged Dr. Denton politely.</p>

<p>The Unknown blushed some more.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" he began somewhat wildly, "please, let's
not. I'm very new at the game, and...."</p>

<p>His voice trailed off, and he sat hunched up in his
chair, looking at me most pitifully. I was honestly sorry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
for him, although not a little intrigued; and most inexplicably
suspicious.</p>

<p>"Here's Wiggles," I said, "let's talk about him. Isn't
he a duck?"</p>

<p>Wiggles, very sleek and beautiful, jumped gaily into
my visitor's lap and they became firm friends at once.</p>

<p>"Why," I said, watching them, "he acts as if he knew
you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Penny looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"I've one much like him, at home," he said. "Perhaps
your puppy recognizes that. All my clothes are very
doggy," he added, with a perfectly charming smile.</p>

<p>"Wiggles," I said, "has excellent judgment&mdash;generally!"</p>

<p>It was impossible not to cast the smallest, swiftest
glance possible at my enemy, as I said it. I had the advantage;
but Dr. Denton, from the ground, deliberately
grinned at me.</p>

<p>"She means," he explained carefully, "that Wiggles
is quite partial to me. And, of course, she cannot understand
it."</p>

<p>He reached up a long, lazy arm and removed the dog
from his friend's lap; then, lying flat on his back and
holding Wiggles quite close to his face, he very calmly
winked at him! And believe it or not, Diary, with my
own eyes I saw Wiggles solemnly and unmistakably <i>wink
back</i>!</p>

<p>If that isn't Black Magic, what is it?</p>

<p>After that, we three chatted comfortably for the better
part of an hour. Mr. Penny, gradually coming forth
from his shell, proved a wholly delightful companion.
And I flirted! I've read about it in books, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
but haven't been able to practise very much. Still, I
think I did very well for a beginner. I am sure Dr. Denton
thought so too, for once I heard him say "Minx!" to
Wiggles, quite fretfully. Anyway, he didn't seem to like
it.</p>

<p>When they got up to go, I begged Mr. Penny to come
again.</p>

<p>His response was very flattering.</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," he began. But Dr. Denton interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"I thought you had a pressing engagement in town,"
he said, significantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Penny made a really magnificent gesture of carelessness.
"I have forgotten it!" he said.</p>

<p>"I'm reminding you," said his "old college chum"
nastily.</p>

<p>I put down my hand to Wiggles, who kissed it obligingly.</p>

<p>"Were you ever in a manger, Wiggles darling?" I
asked with interest.</p>

<p>Wiggles barked. And Mr. Penny, who had just discovered
that Dr. Denton had been lying on his hat, turned
to me with an expression of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, with his ruined headgear
in his hand.</p>

<p>"I was just speaking to Wiggles," I assured him.</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>I have no doubt that he thought me mad. Still, he
must like a certain form of insanity, for his farewell was
almost tragic.</p>

<p>As he left, he bent near me and said, quite low, "I'm
awfully glad you like Richard Warren, Miss Carroll."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked innocently. But, if he answered at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
all, his reply was swallowed up in Dr. Denton's laugh, an
insulting cachinnation, to say the least.</p>

<p>And as <i>he</i> left, the Creature bent near me and said,
quite loudly, "You don't fight fair, Adversary!"</p>

<p>I suppose, Diary, if I repeat how much I dislike him,
you will finally cease to believe me. But I think you
may safely take it for granted.</p>

<p>Isn't it odd that Mr. Penny should be very blond and
shy? It isn't possible that...? Of course not, and
yet.... Well, foolish of me or not, it will be difficult
to write Richard Warren now, as long as I half suspect.
There was a stiltedness about my letter to him today
even. And yet.... I can't quite believe it. Probably
Mr. John Denton was only drawing on his imagination,
after all! Still...?</p>

September 28th</p>

<p>Dear Lady!</p>

<p>I have been out of town for a few days, and when I returned
was greeted by your letter. Even the envelope looked
happy! And I am so supremely glad for you. The keys of
my typewriter would sing like a piano, if they could. Isn't
that the most absurd sentence? But I feel absurdly gay,
myself. For now, perhaps, I can persuade you to let me
come to your next lawn party. You never answered my
question, by the way. So, being a persistent devil, I repeat
it. May I?</p>

<p>Honestly, I eat with a fork, and my hair is cut in accordance
with the usual&mdash;rather hideous&mdash;fashion set for members
of my sex.</p>

<p>I don't seem to remember your friend with the interesting
name. Perhaps, if you could discover his pen name...?
But I really know very few people of writing bent.</p>

<p>I've been out of town, and was delightfully entertained by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
a very old friend of mine. And have come back with tons
of inspiration for the new book, which, by the way, is rapidly
growing. Mr. Denton is anxious for an early publication,
but I do not feel that I can complete the volume until
Spring.</p>

<p>Would you care for it as a coming-out present? I should
be very proud....</p>

<p>Dear little Lady, I am certain that these must be very
trying days for you. And I am holding my thumbs hard!
Our pen and ink friendship has been so dear to me, all these
summer months. It has been both letter and spirit, has it
not? Can you forgive the atrocious punning? And I am
hoping that very soon you will make yourself known to
me, and let me come where you are and tell you.... But,
until you do, I cannot tell you <i>what</i>!</p>

<p>Please, please, don't ask me to let you come! I am so
afraid&mdash;of so many things! And I am certain that you
would be very disillusioned. Really, I'm a most disagreeable
person in the flesh! I can refer you to at least one
person who sees me every day and who thinks so!</p>

<p>Won't you be content to allow me to remain just a small,

October 1, In-the-evening,</p>

<p>Diary dear, I have written Richard Warren that our
acquaintance must remain a pen-and-paper one. It is so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
much wiser to leave things that way. Once, I would have
been tempted.... But somehow, now, I am not.</p>

<p>Adeline, Dr. Denton's cook, arrived this morning armed
with one of her inimitable chocolate cakes, and a note from
her wretched employer. I received her rather coldly,
I am afraid; but I have not yet recovered from the cap-setting
incident. However, she is a disarming creature,
and the cake, which in part graced my luncheon tray, was
delicious. I can't offer you any, but I can set down for
your amusement the accompanying script.</p>

<div class="blockquot p2">

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Green Hill</span><br />
October 1st</p>

<p>My dear Miss Carroll:</p>

<p>As I have a number of messages to deliver to you from
our mutual friend, Penny, and also a matter which I wish
to personally discuss with you, may I invite myself to tea
this afternoon? I have ascertained, you see, that your
father will be in the city!</p>

<p>In a professional capacity, I am able to go and come as
I please. But as this call is quite unprofessional in character,
and partakes somewhat of the nature of an armed
truce, I do not feel that I can come without your consent.</p>

<p>Adeline will wait for your answer. I am, meantime,
scouring the town for a white flag.</p>

<p class="left50">
Yours very sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap left20">William Denton</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2">I must confess, Diary, to a seizure of acute curiosity.
Weakly, I bade Adeline tell her master to wait on me at
four, and sending for Sarah ordered extra tea with which
to placate the savage appetite of my self-bidden guest.
We had tea out-of-doors, for October has come in like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
a spring day, warm and clear and beautiful. I was in my
hammock, whither Sarah and Father had conveyed me at
three, just before Father's train left Green Hill, and had
therefore an hour of speculation. And it was not without
a certain thrill of excitement that I saw a tall, lean figure
swing across the lawn towards me, and appropriate the
low chair beside me and the tea table.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," I said politely.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," he answered, "it was nice of you
to let me come."</p>

<p>Wiggles, a sixth doggie sense telling him I had a caller,
came racing across to us from the kitchen garden, where
I have no doubt he had been destructively employed, and
greeted the Doctor with an exaggerated display of cordiality.
When he was disposed of finally, under my visitor's chair,
"Lovely day," I proffered, one hand concealing
a tiny yawn.</p>

<p>"Lovely!" agreed Dr. Denton, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Conversation languished. Died.</p>

<p>Finally, the silence becoming quite unbearable, I stole
a look at the enemy. His lips were pursed in a noiseless
whistle, his hands were informally in his pocket, and his
eyes were dancing. It is disconcerting that I should have
to acknowledge his extreme good looks. I never did care
much for good-looking men, anyway. They're so disgustingly
conceited. And Dr. Denton possesses an almost
spectacular combination of features, coloring, and build.</p>

<p>"Did you speak?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"I did not!" said I, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot," begged the Unwelcome One. "I'll
come down. Or," he asked anxiously, "can you see the
whites of my eyes?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>I laughed. I couldn't help it. The situation was so
perfectly ridiculous. And so, we laughed together.</p>

<p>Sarah, beaming, appeared with tea and cookies and
cake.</p>

<p>"Please pour," I said to Dr. Denton, "and please have
some of your own cake. Thank you," I added carefully,
"for sending it to us."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't send it," he answered cheerfully, manipulating
china and silver with dexterity. "It was Adeline's
thought. Merely, she asked my permission."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, in a small voice, and accepted a cup of
tea.</p>

<p>Dr. Denton fed Wiggles cake, and engaged him in loud
conversation.</p>

<p>I scalded my throat on tea, and promptly dropped the
cup. This, at least, created some diversion. Dr. Denton
sprang up, scattering Wiggles, cups, napkins, and spoons
with equal indifference, and mopped up the deluge.</p>

<p>"Did you hurt yourself?" he asked, in quite an agonized
tone.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, dripping, "but I have burned my
throat most awfully. I'm afraid I shan't be able to talk
for quite a while."</p>

<p>"May I see?" spoke the physician, with solicitude.</p>

<p>I put out my tongue very soberly.</p>

<p>Dr. Denton returned hastily to his chair.</p>

<p>"You spoke," I suggested, "in your note, of messages."</p>

<p>"Did I?" he returned, in a puzzled tone. "It must be
my handwriting. No doctor writes intelligibly."</p>

<p>This was really too much. I beat with my fist upon
the unoffending hammock, and asked, "Has your
friend...?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone? Yes, very unfortunately. He had, as I reminded
him, a pressing engagement in town. I, myself,
took him to the train," concluded the aggravating creature
proudly.</p>

<p>"How nice of you," I said heartily, "but you must miss
him."</p>

<p>"Intolerably."</p>

<p>The duologue showed symptoms of declining again.</p>

<p>Finally,</p>

<p>"Did you want to see me?" I asked courteously.</p>

<p>"Not particularly," he replied, "but under the white
flag, as I suggested, I wanted to make a partial treaty
with you, with, of course, your consent."</p>

<p>"I am listening," I said cautiously.</p>

<p>Suddenly he moved his chair nearer, crossed his legs,
and lay back, hands locked across his knees.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "isn't it time that we declared
ourselves in open battle? This guerilla warfare ..."
he paused, suggestively, and I waited.</p>

<p>"You have made it very plain," he went on, "that you
do not like me. Perhaps I am putting it mildly. At all
events, as your medical adviser, I am forced to inflict my
presence frequently upon you. Your father likes me.
Sarah likes me; Wiggles likes me. Couldn't you," he
asked earnestly, "try to overcome your aversion, for the
sake of the majority?"</p>

<p>I considered.</p>

<p>"I think not," I said finally.</p>

<p>"Very well. Having appealed to your filial respect,
your better self, there is nothing to do but ask you to
sign a temporary armistice. For I am beginning to find
your concentrated attack rather ... wearing."</p>

<p>I smiled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish," said Dr. Denton carefully, "to give you
every opportunity to humiliate and infuriate me. I have
always believed a little aversion to be an excellent beginning
to matrimony. I don't suppose," he continued hopefully,
"that by way of simplifying things you would care
to marry me?"</p>

<p>He bit into a large sugar cookie reflectively.</p>

<p>"Marry!" I shouted, sitting bolt upright. I can do it
now, Diary, if the occasion demands.</p>

<p>"Marry," said he, with the utmost calmness, but with
twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>I collapsed.</p>

<p>"I think you are perfectly insane," I began. And then
ceased, for want of words.</p>

<p>Dr. Denton sighed.</p>

<p>"I was afraid I couldn't persuade you," he said. "Let
us pass to the next point."</p>

<p>I was still gasping, like a fish.</p>

<p>"You find your throat better with your mouth open?"
he asked, with interest.</p>

<p>I closed it with a snap. And kept it closed.</p>

<p>"As my wife," he remarked, "you would have ample
opportunities for delicate and refined torture. However....
You have called me, perhaps rightly, a 'brute'. Am
I to infer that you still continue to regard me in that unflattering
light?"</p>

<p>I nodded. Speech, by now, was wholly beyond me.</p>

<p>"And I," he went on, "have intimated what I, as an
honest man, think of you. It is quite plain that I do not
like you any better than you like me. You have, I think,
the makings of a rather nice girl. But I have never cared
for ... kittens. Now that we are agreed to disagree,
Miss Carroll, will you shake hands with me, and for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
sake of our enforced relationship, pledge yourself neither
to stab me in the back or bite me, when I am not looking?
When you are quite well again, I am at your mercy. But
until then, I must entreat you not to hamper your recovery,
and blast my medical reputation, by consistently opposing
me at every turn. Are you willing to play friends
with me until such time when I can set you on your
feet?"</p>

<p>He held out his hand and smiled. The whole thing was
ridiculous, and he had been unnecessarily insulting. And
yet ... it was a nice smile, Diary. I have even seen my
Peterkins smile just like that, hopefully, ingratiatingly.
And after all, I do owe him so much.</p>

<p>Silently I laid my hand in his.</p>

<p>"Good!" said he, gripping it. "And tomorrow you
are going to sit up, in a real, substantial chair. After
that, you'll be walking before you know it."</p>

<p>The silly tears came to my eyes.</p>

<p>"I am grateful...." I faltered.</p>

<p>"Don't be," he said cheerfully, "if you dislike the
sensation. It's all in the interest of science, you know."</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers at Wiggles, and got up to go.</p>

<p>"I'm going for Sarah," he said, "you must be taken
back to your room now. It's getting chilly."</p>

<p>Once having established me in my room, Dr. Denton
bent over me.</p>

<p>"And," he said, very much under his breath, "won't
you consider my proposal? I meant it, you know!"</p>

<p>And then he had gone.</p>

<p>I'd like to accept him, out of spite, Diary. And, never
having expected a proposal, I find even this one somehow
exciting.</p>

<p>Diary, if only you could talk!

October 14
</p>

<p>Diary, it is quite two weeks since I have made an entry,
but the thrills of actually sitting up, in a big chair, downstairs
in front of a seasonable log fire, and the even more
exciting adventure of short wheel-chair rides in the sheltered
paths of a chrysanthemum garden, have for the moment
entirely occupied my time and thoughts. Even to
the exclusion of you! And now, Father is talking of
taking me South for the winter. Just as soon as I am
able to walk a little, he wants to take me&mdash;and Sarah&mdash;and
Wiggles&mdash;to Florida, so that I need not undergo the
trials of a Northern winter.</p>

<p>I am worried about Father. He does not look, and is
not, at all well. The old trouble, which dates back to his
Spanish-American War days, has returned, and with it,
disquieting heart symptoms. I got Dr. Mac off in a corner,
lately, and asked him to tell me truly what he thought
of Father's condition. "He seems so <i>tired</i> all the time,"
I said. And Dr. Mac looked very grave.</p>

<p>"Lassie," he told me, "Your father's a sick man. And
a careless one. He's not minded his own aches and pains
all these years, nor spared himself. And he's not as young
as he was."</p>

<p>When I said something to Father, he laughed at me.</p>

<p>"MacAllister is an old woman," he said, "fussing and
fretting. I'll be all right presently, my little girl. Don't
worry. The main thing is to get you on your feet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
then we'll be off to Florida for a long, long holiday. Bless
that boy!" he added, and I knew that he meant Dr.
Denton.</p>

<p>Well, I bless him too, when Sarah wheels me down the
garden paths and I reach out to touch the big friendly
flowers. I feel so strong, so strong! They have to
watch me now, for I am like to do all manner of foolish
things, with the old languor gone, and the new red blood
singing through my veins.</p>

<p>But when Doctor Denton comes and looks at me out
of those cool eyes, and asks, "Well, how are the tantrums
lately, Miss Carroll?" I'm in no mood for blessing him
then!</p>

<p class="p2 left65">

October 20
</p>

<p>Oh! Oh! Diary, if you ever go automobiling, you'll
never be content to sit in my desk drawer again. It's
too wonderful! This morning, bundled up to my eyes,
I was taken from my chair, lifted into Mr. John Denton's
great, grey, purring beast, and with Dr. William
Denton at the wheel, and Father and Mr. Denton beside
me, I was taken, quietly and smoothly, over the hill road,
down the valley, and through the wide Meadow Road,
on my first tour of exploration.</p>

<p>Eleven years! Eleven years!</p>

<p>Back through the village we came, after an all too short
half-hour. Somehow the news had spread, and from
every gate and window, hands waved and friendly faces
peered. They were glad to see me, the Green Hill people.</p>

<p>"Is she crying?" asked Dr. Denton at the wheel, with
interest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>I wanted to. I wanted to cry and laugh and shout all
at once. Instead I folded my hands more tightly in
Father's and said demurely, "Sorry, but she isn't."</p>

<p>Dr. Denton nodded, slouched down in his seat, his
strong brown hands doing marvellous things to the wheel.</p>

<p>"Please," I asked Mr. Denton, "next time you take
me riding, will you drive, and may I sit in the front seat
and watch you steer?"</p>

<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<p>"Ask Bill," answered my old friend, "I've just sold
him the car."</p>

<p>"You may ride in the front seat&mdash;with me," announced
Dr. Denton graciously, before I had time to
withdraw my request, "always providing that you do
not clutch my arm at inopportune moments, or scream
as you did six minutes back," he added, "when that
mongrel pup appeared on the horizon, a good mile
away."</p>

<p>"I don't think," I said, "that, after all, I'd care for
the front seat."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the chauffeur obligingly, as, with
a turn and twist we rolled up smoothly before my own
front door, where Sarah, apron flying in the wind, stood,
the tears shining on her dear old face.</p>

<p>Front seat or back, I am to ride every day, as long
as the good weather holds, for it has been prescribed for
me by no less than two physicians in reputable professional
standing; no matter what their respective dispositions.
And, Diary, I love it so that, for the sake of the
swift silent motion, I would cheerfully ride in any seat
whatsoever, regardless of the driver. So low have I
sunk in my new passion.</p>

<p>"Nervous?" asked Dr. Denton, as he helped carry me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
to my room. I am conveyed now as children are, on
crossed hands with supporting arms about my back.</p>

<p>"Not at all!" I answered indignantly.</p>

<p>"That's good," said he, "for I am a fearsome driver.
I have," he said, sinking his voice to an awe-inspiring
whisper, "been known to kill my men in my day. And
any amount of dogs. Strong men as I pass have turned
pale, and women fainted on the streets!"</p>

<p>He and Mr. Denton laid me on my bed, and I could
only look at him with scorn, from that ignominious position.
Oh, when I can stand on my two feet, won't I&mdash;well,
won't I <i>just</i>!!!!</p>

<p class="p2 left65">
<span class="smcap">Green Hill</span><br />
November 1</p>

<p>Diary, this day I have stood upright, and taken my
first faltering step forward. Dr. Mac was there, and
Dr. Denton, one on each side. And a step away, with
his arms wide, my Father. Sarah, her hand on Dr. Mac's
arm, took the step with me. She was quite white.</p>

<p>I was terribly weak, and all bendy in the middle. But
I walked, Diary, I <i>walked</i>.</p>

<p>I am in bed now, after having been fussed over and
made much of. I am sure Father is out sending wires!
And Sarah pops in every two minutes to see if I am
still alive. I am very much alive, and my whole soul is
on its knees in gratitude. Now, almost for the first time,
I believe that I am to be a cog in the Great Machinery
again; and no longer a little broken thing, thrown out forever
on the scrap heap.</p>

<p>I want to tell Richard Warren. But no word has come
from him since my last letter. So I must wait.

December 8</p>

<p>It seems a year since I last opened you, little Blue
Friend. For so much has happened. I walk, as if I
had always walked, and it no longer seems wonderful
or blessed. For my Father is very ill. He is up and
dressed and around, but I know and he knows that it may
not be for very long. He has been to town, to see other
doctors. And when he came back, he set his house in
order.</p>

<p>After he had told me his exact condition, "Mavis,"
he said, "you are the bravest person, except your Mother,
I have ever known. It may be that I shall live for
years; it may be that it is only a matter of weeks or
months. I don't know. The doctors hold out very little
hope of my recovery. You are better fitted to help me
now than ever you were. And," he said smiling, "it
seems as if I had nothing more to live for, now that you
are well again, and growing stronger every day."</p>

<p>I was on his lap, in the big still living room.</p>

<p>"Father, father," I said, and held his dear head close
against my breast. They can't take him from me!
They can't!</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said. "We have had many years of the
most beautiful, close companionship together, my daughter.
You have given me more than you know. And for
a long time I have known...."</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" I asked, fighting back the
tears.</p>

<p>"I talked it over," he said, "with Dr. Denton, and we
decided that it was not wise&mdash;as your condition stood
then."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>Always Dr. Denton! Ordering my life....</p>

<p>"If only," said Father, very low, "if only I could leave
you guarded, protected. You know so little of life.... I
am," he whispered to himself, "responsible to her
mother...."</p>

<p>We were quiet a long time.</p>

<p>Presently he put me from him.</p>

<p>"There, there," he said, "I hear Peter calling you
outside. Run along, dearest. And let me see you smile
before you go. It may be that we will have a long time
yet together. Kiss me, Mavis, and smile."</p>

<p>Diary, I am so terribly frightened. So alone.</p>

December 21</p>

<p>We are getting ready for Christmas. The Green Hill
people have sent me, with their love, a beautiful, courageous
tree. And everyone has offered to come and trim
it. But we must be very quiet on this, my first real
Christmas for many years. For Father is failing steadily.
He does not complain, but he spends a great deal of the
day in bed; and he is so white, so worn, that my heart
stands still to look at him. If only I could have stayed
all my life in my little rose-grey room, helpless and
cared for, if by some strange twist of Fate my Father
could have been spared this wasting illness.</p>

<p>I hate my feet; so eager to run; I hate my new sense
of well-being and vitality. I hate the faint pink in my
cheeks, and all my untired strength.</p>

<p>It is snowing today. White and soft and thick snow
lies over my garden. Like a.... No, I can't write it....

December 28</p>

<p>Christmas is over and done with. I had so many
lovely gifts, more than ever this year, it seems. I have
put them away&mdash;the books from Mr. Denton, the little
gold watch from Father, even Peter's funny little hand-painted
card. And all the others. I can't seem to be
grateful for anything. Wonderful roses reached me from
the city, Christmas morning. There is no card. But
I know who sent them. Why doesn't he write? He
would help, a little, I think. But I can't write to him.
Not now.</p>

<p class="p2 left65">
<span class="smcap">Green Hill</span><br />
January 1</p>

<p>The new year.</p>

<p>I ran over to see Mrs. Goodrich this morning. She is
terribly distressed because Mr. Goodrich's firm is sending
him abroad, and he wants her to go with him. They will
be travelling too much to take Peter and have decided
against it. Of course I asked for him. And she will let
me know. Father, when I told him, shook his head.
He said nothing, but I knew what he was thinking.</p>

<p class="p2 left65">
<span class="smcap">Green Hill</span><br />
January 2</p>

<p>Father asked me today if I liked Dr. Denton. He
asked me so wistfully and so strangely that I couldn't
tell him the truth. They are great friends, I know. So
I lied.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I said, "I like him very much."</p>

<p>I felt myself grow red. Father patted my hand.</p>

<p>"He's a good man," he said. "I want you to trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
him, Mavis. I have made John Denton your guardian&mdash;you
know so little about money and the dull things of
life," he added, half sighing, half smiling. "You are,
after all, only a child."</p>

<p>I tried to change the subject, as I always do, when
directly or indirectly Father speaks of leaving me. He
seemed happier, when I left him, than I have seen him
in many days. I am glad, Diary, that I lied to him
about the Enemy.</p>

<p class="p2 left65">
<span class="smcap">Green Hill</span><br />
January 10</p>

<p>This morning Father was worse. I rushed to the
'phone and tried to get Dr. Mac, but he was out, making
his calls. So Dr. Denton came. He sent me from the
room, and was with Father a long, long time. When he
came out, he called me.</p>

<p>"Your father wishes to see you, Miss Carroll," he said.</p>

<p>"Dr. Denton&mdash;" I couldn't say any more. Suddenly
he took my two ice-cold hands in his firm, warm grasp.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, almost sternly, "that I am at
your service, always, and at his."</p>

<p>He dropped my hands and turned away.</p>

<p>"I shall be back," he told me, "in the afternoon."</p>

<p>Shaking all over, I laid my hand on the doorknob and
prayed, over and over, just "Please, God, help him,"
and went in.</p>

<p>Father, very white, held out his hands. "Come here,"
he said. And when I was beside him,</p>

<p>"Mavis," he said, "the thought of leaving you alone&mdash;now
that I feel certain that I must leave you, is unbearable.
I have been talking today with Dr. Denton. He
wants to marry you, my dear, and take care of you always,
for me. He has been like my own son to me, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
boy. He is straight and true and clean. And I think
that I could go on my long journey with very few regrets,
my Mavis, if I knew that you were in as safe
hands as his."</p>

<p>Cruel! Cruel!</p>

<p>My heart almost stopped, and then raced on again. I
couldn't speak. Father, his hand on mine, looked at me
wistfully, entreatingly. I couldn't bear to have him
look like that. Like a beggar. And yet, for a moment,
I had absolutely no impulse of love toward him. He was
a stranger to me, my own Father. It was impossible
that it was his voice asking me to do this unthinkable
thing.</p>

<p>"Mavis?"</p>

<p>"I can't," I said, in a whisper.</p>

<p>His hand loosened from mine. Dropped wearily to
the bed,</p>

<p>"Very well, dearest," he said, "of course you shall
do nothing against your will. I only thought...." he
stopped, and then, "It seemed a solution," he finished.</p>

<p>He looked very tired. All my love for him came rushing
back. I kissed him, and he held me close for an instant.</p>

<p>"Will you&mdash;think it over?" he asked slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Father," I said, and was rewarded by his old
brilliant smile.</p>

<p>Once out of the room, I brushed past Sarah, hovering
near the door, and went to my own room. There, lying
on my bed, I "thought it over."</p>

<p>What was it Dr. Denton said to me,&mdash;"you owe your
father something."</p>

<p>I have cried until I have no tears left, rebellious, sick
at heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>I can't. And yet ... if it would make him any happier....</p>

<p>The bell is ringing. If that is Dr. Denton, I will see
him before he goes to Father.</p>

<p class="p2 left65">
Late at night.</p>

<p>I have said that I will marry William Denton.</p>

<p class="p2 left65">
<span class="smcap">Green Hill</span><br />
January 12</p>

<p>It is only a matter of days with Father now. Dr.
Denton told me that, when we had our talk two
days ago. He listened to what I had to say, very quietly,
standing in front of the fire, his arms crossed, and looking
down at the great chair in which I was half
buried.</p>

<p>After he had told me about Father, "If you will marry
me, Miss Carroll," he said, "I will do my best to carry
out your father's wishes. I cannot make you happy&mdash;that
I know&mdash;but I can make you&mdash;safe. Until such
time as you do not need my protection."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"I mean," he answered gravely, "that you are very
young and that the abnormal life which your accident
forced you to lead has peculiarly unfitted you for any
solitary encounter with the world. If you would trust
yourself to me, I promise faithfully to care for you, to
watch over you, and to help you through the first bewildering
time. After that&mdash;you may dispose of me as
you see fit."</p>

<p>"You mean?" I whispered again.</p>

<p>He smiled, sombrely. "I am not trying to bind you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to me," he said. "I am asking you for your Father's
sake, to let me take care of you for a time. When you
are quite strong, and quite able to look out for yourself,
it will remain for me to step aside, and you will be free
to do and go as you please."</p>

<p>Something of hope stirred faintly in me. "You will let
me go then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>I laid my face against the soft cushions of the chair.</p>

<p>"Marriage," I said, under my breath, "I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>I couldn't go on.</p>

<p>"It will not be," he said very gently, "a marriage, Miss
Carroll. It will be a business arrangement. You may
have my sacred word of honor that I will not trouble
you in any way. And that as soon as possible I will
take the steps to make you quite free again."</p>

<p>I stood up and faced him.</p>

<p>"You think that Father really wishes this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is, I know, his heart's desire," said Dr. Denton,
"and I am tremendously honored by his faith in me."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, and held out my hand.</p>

<p>Silently, he took it.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mavis," he said quietly.</p>

<p>I was conscious of a longing to escape; it was as if
a fine silken cord were tightening about me.</p>

<p>"Shall we go to Father?" I asked him.</p>

<p>Without another word we two walked from the room.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said to me at the door, "this is for
your father. We must make believe for him, you and
I."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>The door closed behind us.

<p>I am to be married tomorrow. It is Father's wish.
He is weaker, but suffers no pain, and he recognizes us
all.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours to my wedding. Please God that
Father will never know how I dread it.</p>

<p>Mr. John Denton is to give me away. And we are
to be married from this house, with no one but the
Goodriches and Mr. Denton present at the ceremony.
Ceremony! The mockery of it!</p>

<p>Dr. Denton has given me a ring. It was his Mother's,
he said. I have never asked him about his Mother. I do
not even know if he has told her.</p>

<p>Nothing seems to matter very much. Father....
<i>Father</i>....</p>

<p>William&mdash;he has asked me to call him that&mdash;came
to me this morning, and for the first time in days we
talked together for more than a moment.</p>

<p>"You are frightened," he said to me, "and nervous.
You need not be."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why are you marrying me?" I asked him
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why are you marrying me?" he countered.</p>

<p>"Father," I said, and stopped.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I, too," he said simply.</p>

<p>All at once I realized what a tremendous sacrifice he
was making. I tried, very poorly, to tell him.</p>

<p>"Not at all," he assured me, "I am perfectly clear as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
to what I am doing. And my own motives. I shall be,
after all," he added, "perfectly free&mdash;except perhaps
outwardly."</p>

<p>There was something in his voice.... I got to my feet.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, "it is understood that we are both
free? Except perhaps outwardly?"</p>

<p>I do not think he liked it.</p>

<p class="p2 left65">
January 21</p>

<p>This afternoon, at four, I was married to Dr. William
Denton, in the room next door to Father's. They let
me see him right afterwards; and he put his dear thin
white hand on my forehead and smiled.</p>

<p>William has moved over to the house to be near
Father, and after the grave congratulations of our few
friends, we were alone together in the quiet house.
Married. And as far apart as Pole from Pole. Diary,
you who have guarded my girlhood so jealously, it is
Good-by now. I have come to the end of the chapter.
And there will be nothing in my future life that I shall
want to record. There is only this:</p>

<p>Uncle John brought me today a letter. From Richard
Warren. I opened it ten minutes ago, alone in my room.
It was a short letter. It asked if he might come to me;
it said that he had loved me all these months; it was
signed, "Your Lover, Richard Warren."</p>

<p>It came too late, dear Diary. I will lay it among your
pages, with my dreams and my hopes and my sorrow.</p>

<p>Good-by. With a very steady hand, I, by some mysterious
alchemy of the Law and the Church, Mrs. William
Denton, write this last word on your pages.</p>

<p class="p2 center">
<i>Finis</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER VIII</p>

<p class="p2">The last word had been written in my Diary. Wearily,
I stood erect and brushed the loosened hair from my eyes.
The house was very still; in all my life I had never been
so utterly alone. I turned from my desk, and, as I did
so, caught a glimpse of my face in the wall-mirror. That
was not I&mdash;that white-faced girl, with the frightened
eyes and shaken mouth.</p>

<p>"Mavis...."</p>

<p>I saw the mirrored eyes grow dark, the tremulous
mouth straighten into lines of control before I left my
curiously impersonal scrutiny of myself and opened the
door for my husband.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Your father is awake," said Bill, very tall and broad-shouldered
on the threshold. "I have been trying to
persuade him to have a nurse, but he won't listen to me."</p>

<p>"Sarah is better than any hospital graduate," I answered,
"and I am quite strong enough to be with him
now."</p>

<p>"As you wish," he answered gently. "But I think
you over-estimate your strength, my dear."</p>

<p>I walked past him into the hall.</p>

<p>"Sarah has prepared the guest room for you," I said.
"It is next door to father."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>He walked with me to the door of the sick-room, stood
aside and let me enter alone. Father was still conscious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
he knew me, tried to raise his hand. I put mine over
it and sat for the rest of the afternoon by his bed. Sometimes
he seemed to sleep, and I watched him with a
passion of sorrow and love unlike anything I had ever
known. All his defences were down, all his barriers of
reserve. He was like a child, and, I thought, quietly
happy and at peace. It is difficult to set down on paper
how I yearned over him as the slow hours dragged by.
But when Sarah came to relieve me and I rose, stiff and
cramped from long sitting, I was conscious that, somehow,
I had come to grips with myself, had seen for the
first time what I owed to my father, had realized fully
his sacrifice and his unfailing thought of me. It was as
if we had talked together, we two, a long intimate hour.
And I knew then, as never before, that I owed him
not duty nor obedience, for those are unloving words,
but tenderness and endless gratitude. If before he left
me forever, my marriage was the one thing to bring him
peace, then no matter how mistaken his love for me had
been in that instance, I had been more than right to do
for him as he wished. The fact that in so doing I had
probably ruined two lives, was of minor consideration.</p>

<p>Two days went by. On the evening of the second,
the doctors held out very little hope that my father would
live through the night. I watched with them until morning.
I had no tears left. I had come to a place where
no tears were, a place too deep to be stirred by emotion
or even grief.</p>

<p>As the dawn came in, pale and cold, Dr. McAllister
turned from the bed and took his hand from father's
wrist. He looked old and grey&mdash;dear Doctor Mac, but
his eyes were radiant.</p>

<p>"He'll pull through!" he said simply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>All about me was a singing darkness. Through it I
heard a voice say sharply, "Look to the lassie, Bill!"
and felt strong arms around me. Before I lost complete
consciousness I remember putting up my hand to
brush something wet from my face. Tears? Not <i>my</i>
tears.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," I said childishly. "It hurts father to
see people cry."</p>

<p>When I woke again it was bright daylight. I was in
my own room on my own bed. My husband was sitting,
his hands between his knees, beside me.</p>

<p>For a moment I stared at him. Then, as knowledge
flashed through me like a terrifying tide,</p>

<p>"Father?" I questioned, very low.</p>

<p>"He's all right, Mavis," said Dr. Denton quietly.
"The danger is past&mdash;thank God!"</p>

<p>I put out my hand, gropingly, and he took it firmly
into his.</p>

<p>"Cry now," he said gently. "It will help."</p>

<p>Then, in a rush, came the healing, peace-giving tears.</p>

<p class="p2">It was not until ten days later, when father, marvellously
recuperating, sat up for the first time and demanded
his "children" about him that I faced the fact
that what was done could not be undone, and that I
was confronted by the finality of marriage.</p>

<p>"Well, you two," said father weakly, but with a tiny
glimmer of mischief in his eyes, "it looks as if I had
hurried you before the altar under false pretences.
What are you going to do about it&mdash;now that I've
fooled you by living?"</p>

<p>Beneath his half-laughter, I heard a note of anxiety,
of doubt. And the resolution rose up strong and compelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
within me that never, as long as I lived, should
father know what he had done. It was the only way
in which I could pay my debt.</p>

<p>"Play the game, Mavis," I said to myself, and smiled
straight into father's eyes.</p>

<p>Bill, sitting beside me, drew a long breath. Was it
relief? I glanced at him quickly and knew that for
one moment we agreed.</p>

<p>"You old matchmaker," I said, "were you so afraid
that I would never find a husband? Was it quite necessary
to frighten us all to pieces in order that I should
wear a wedding ring?"</p>

<p>Father laughed.</p>

<p>"Then," he asked, "It's all right&mdash;with you two?"</p>

<p>I turned to Bill and saw him nod once before I spoke.</p>

<p>"It's all right," I said, "and we're all happy."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said father under his breath.</p>

<p>I could not bear the look on his face, and slipped
blindly, without excuse, from the room.</p>

<p>It was the following week that John Denton came
down to be with us, and hatched his plans with father.
They called us in, Bill and me, and laid their schemes
before us.</p>

<p>"We have decided," said father, very thin and pale
in his armchair, "that children are best left alone, without
old people to disturb them. I'm quite all right. In
two weeks I shall be younger and better than I have been
in twenty years. And I want you and Bill to go away,
Mavis. It's time you had your honeymoon, cloudless
and solitary, as all honeymoons should be. Old John
here has been talking his camp in Canada to me, for
an hour steady. And I'm persuaded. I'll get you infants
out of the house, and then John and I and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
marvelous man-servant of his who is cook and nurse
and valet in one person will travel by easy stages and
spend a month rusticating in the big woods.</p>

<p>"Can't we go too?" I begged, in a sudden panic.</p>

<p>"You can <i>not</i>!" said Uncle John and father in one
breath.</p>

<p>I turned a little helplessly to my husband.</p>

<p>"They don't want us!" I said.</p>

<p>"And we don't want them!" he answered smiling.
"You and I are going to Cuba. Just as soon as you can
get ready. I've been talking to your father and he
agrees with me that the absolute change will do you
all the good in the world."</p>

<p>"Cuba!"</p>

<p>"Exactly. There is a perfectly good plantation there
just waiting for us."</p>

<p>"But...." I said, sparring for time, "I couldn't leave
Sarah."</p>

<p>Father laughed outright. "You baby!" he said,
caressingly.</p>

<p>"You won't have to," said Bill. "She needs a rest
as much as you do. She's coming along&mdash;and so is
your friend Peter. We can't leave him behind, and Mr.
Goodrich has to sail for Spain sooner than he expected.
I saw him this morning."</p>

<p>I was too amazed for words. And over my defenceless
head the affair was settled. Canada for father and
Uncle John; Cuba for Sarah, Peter, Bill, and me. A
thousand protests, the old rebellious anger at having my
life settled and ordered for me, rushed over me again.
But father's eyes were on me and I choked back my resentment.</p>

<p>"Cuba it is!" I said, forcing a smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>And so, after the maze of packing, of sending Sarah
to New York for summer clothes&mdash;in the dead of winter!&mdash;after
the farewells and the blessings and the
thought-deadening hurry and bustle&mdash;Cuba it was.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER IX</p>

<p class="p2">It was decided that my husband and I should go to
New York by motor, spending the night with his uncle,
Peter and Sarah to join us the following day, so that the
last packing could be leisurely attended to before we
sailed.</p>

<p>I had my farewells with father alone. Dr. Denton
went in first and came out looking more moved than I
believed possible. If I could have liked him at all, it
would have been for his devotion to my father.</p>

<p>I can't write about how dear father was when he told
me good-by.</p>

<p>John Denton went up to town with us. I begged him
to, and he very naturally attributed my nervousness and
pallor to the long strain of my father's illness. He was
very good to me.</p>

<p>Leaving my house, in a sense for the first time, and
knowing it would be months before I saw it again, I experienced
a sinking of the heart that was terrible. Not
till then had I realized how much my home meant to
me, how much freedom had been mine beneath it's little
roof, how lovingly the friendly walls had safeguarded
and sheltered me.</p>

<p>At the door, I clung first to Mrs. Goodrich and then,
for a long, close moment, to Sarah. She seemed a rock
of strength, the last familiar landmark. But strong
hands drew me away from her, and presently I was in
the closed car, and we were off for New York.</p>

<p>I had very little sensation: only a feeling of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
numbness and a consciousness that if I could know any
emotion it would be that of an infinite despair. I was
dimly grateful that I need not go by train. In this, at
least, they had humored me. All through the long ride,
I sat huddled in the new furs which were Uncle John's
wedding gift to me, my eyes closed, and my hand in
John Denton's warm clasp. I did not hear what the two
men said to one another. Possibly, when they spoke to
me, I answered. I do not know.</p>

<p>Something of the terrifying maelstrom of the city
traffic penetrated my stupor as we came smoothly into
town. It was all so new ... the noise and rush and bewilderment
of it. The lights were beginning to flare
up all about me: faces seen in the crowds struck at me
like a blow. Such hungry, restless, seeking faces....
But here and there, the happy eyes of a girl clinging to
a man's arm, or walking alone with her dreams, stood
out for me, and brought the tears to my eyes. Wearily
I thought, if I could only cry again&mdash;for it seemed so
long since I had known the release of tears.</p>

<p>I must have fainted when we reached the house, for
the next thing I remember is waking up in a great,
wide bed, in a huge, high-ceilinged room, with a kindly,
round old woman fussing over me.</p>

<p>"You're to lie still, dearie," she said, as I tried to
sit up, "and have a bite of supper on a tray. 'Tis the
Doctor's orders, ma'am," and she smiled at me with a
certain shy sweetness, and tucked a billowy eiderdown
quilt more closely about my feet. I discovered then
that I was undressed and surrounded by hot-water bottles.</p>

<p>I tried to thank her, but words were difficult. I was
so very tired.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>Someone knocked.</p>

<p>"It's himself, surely," said the old woman, as she
hastened to open, and then stood aside, her hands beneath
her apron, to let my husband come in. He thanked her,
dismissed her, and came straight to my bedside, where
he stood looking down at me.</p>

<p>I drew the clothes tight about my throat and looked at
him mutely.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" he asked, retrieving one of my
submerged hands and placing a steady finger on the
pulse.</p>

<p>"Tired," I answered, and then, "Oh, Doctor Denton,
when will Sarah be here?"</p>

<p>I knew quite well: but something unreasonable in me
hoped that I had slept a whole twenty-four hours away
and that I would very soon hear her comforting step
outside my door.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," he answered, and added with a suspicion
of a smile, "but I thought we were agreed that
Doctor Denton, as a form of address, is taboo, under the
circumstances."</p>

<p>"William, then," I said, with a great weariness in my
heart.</p>

<p>"Could you manage Bill?" he asked. "I have unpleasant
associations with my full name: it always reminds
me of the woodshed, and my father's strong right
hand."</p>

<p>Absurdly enough, I heard my own voice saying solemnly:</p>

<p>"Father called me William, Mother called me Will,
Sister called me Willie, but the fellers called me Bill."</p>

<p>I stopped suddenly, wondering if I were going quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
mad. But there was reassuring laughter in the eyes
bent upon me.</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>I attempted to laugh. It was a very poor effort,
and ended in tears.</p>

<p>Dr. Denton sat down on the bed and took me into his
arms, pressing my head against his shoulder. I didn't
care. I cried there very comfortably, for a long time.</p>

<p>"It's all right," I heard his voice saying, coming, so it
seemed, from a great distance. "It's all right. You'll
feel lots better for it, Mavis."</p>

<p>After a while, I dried my eyes and lay back against
the pillows again. The intolerable burden about
my heart had eased a little, in some miraculous
manner.</p>

<p>"And now," announced my husband, "Mrs. Cardigan
is going to bring you some supper. After that, she will
make you comfortable for the night, and you are to
drink what I send you. Uncle John sends his love and
the demand that you pour his coffee for him in the
morning, or, if you do not feel strong enough, you are
to stay in bed, he says, and he will come up and pour
yours! And I shall be next door to you, if you want
anything in the night. But I am sure that you are going
to sleep soundly."</p>

<p>He rose and looked down on me once more.</p>

<p>"Good night," he said. "Sleep well."</p>

<p>"Good night," I answered, "Dr.&mdash;B-B-Bill!"</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled, just for a moment.</p>

<p>"Good night," he responded, "Miss&mdash;M-M-Mavis!"</p>

<p>He opened the door for Mrs. Cardigan and her tray,
stood aside, waved to me once, and was gone. All
the way down the hall I heard him singing: "You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
are old, Father William" in a pleasant, gay baritone.</p>

<p>Suddenly I realized I was hungry.</p>

<p>I awoke the following morning feeling almost happy.
There was a wonderful sense of adventure in looking
out of my windows over the grey city streets, in hearing
the hurrying footsteps go past me. So many people!
So many sorrows and joys passing beneath my window,
so many eager feet going out to meet the day! I felt
very small, almost insignificant, very unimportant.</p>

<p>"It's like an angel you're looking today, Mrs. Denton!"
said Mrs. Cardigan amiably, as she brought me my
breakfast, with Uncle John following hard on her heels.</p>

<p>"And it's blushing she is!" added the honest creature
in amazement.</p>

<p>Uncle John laid his hand on the shoulder of the old
woman who had been nurse and housekeeper and almost-mother
to him for thirty years.</p>

<p>"Run off with you, Mary," he said, laughing. "Mrs.
Denton isn't used to blarney!"</p>

<p>"And her with the fine young husband!" said Mrs.
Cardigan in obvious astonishment as she backed to the
door.</p>

<p>Uncle John looked at me with laughing eyes: but I
could not meet his glance.</p>

<p>The rest of the day is more or less of a blur to me
now. Sarah came, with Peter and Wiggles. It was a
matter for debate, which of the two last mentioned was
the more excited. But it is certain that Peter talked
more. His ideas of Cuba were wonderful and strange,
and it was only by dint of dire threats of being left on
the dock that we finally persuaded him to go to bed.</p>

<p>The following morning, February tenth, with the thermometer
flirting with zero, we sailed for Cuba.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah and I had connecting cabins: and I bribed a
blonde, friendly steward to let me conceal Wiggles behind
locked doors and thus keep him with us. On the
other side of me, Dr. Denton was housed with Peter. All
the cabins were full of flowers and fruit and books, and
I am sure that, although I may have concealed it better,
I was quite as excited as Peter and the pup.</p>

<p>It was, they tell me, a rough passage. Somehow, I
didn't seem to mind. To lie in a deck-chair, muffled to
the eyes, and to watch the ocean seemed all that I wanted
in life. I never tired of it. Grey and green and blue,
as the fog or the sun caught it, there was never anything
as wonderful as my first sight of the sea. I was even
glad of the storms that delayed us longer than usual.
For, even beyond Cape Hatteras, we had wind, and
snow and cold. And then came a day when, little by
little, people began to crawl greenly up from their
cabins, shed their sweaters, and take an interest in
life. Sarah among them. Poor dear, she had succumbed
almost before we left the dock! Every dip of
the boat, every rising and falling swell was met by her
with the gloomy announcement that she wanted to die.
Once, when I peered in at her, I found my husband sitting
by her berth and answering quite gravely, her innumerable
questions as to how they conducted burials at sea.
Were they conducted "with decent Christian rites?"
she was demanding weakly.</p>

<p>As I walked the deck with him, braced against the salt
wind, my hair flying under my fur cap,</p>

<p>"You shouldn't tease Sarah!" I said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't I?" he asked, forcibly restraining Peter
from going over the rail&mdash;shouting, "I see a mermaid,
Aunt Mavis!" "Perhaps not. But to the good sailor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
seasickness is always a matter, inexplicable and humorous."</p>

<p>"By the way, I'm glad," he continued, "that you've
stood the trip so well. It would be a pity," said he
pensively, "to have injected into the romance of a honeymoon
the very mundane element of mal-de-mer...."</p>

<p>I turned on my heel to leave him, but reckoned without
the tremendous wave which swung lazily up to the
boat, smote it, held it suspended a breathless moment,
and then let it down again with unparalleled suddenness.
My husband's arm intervened between me and the rail,
checking my mad career in mid-air.</p>

<p>"Steady on," he said. "We've not reached tropical
waters yet."</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but take his proffered arm
and walk on, in haughty silence.</p>

<p>We sat at the Captain's table, and for the greater part
of the trip we and the Captain sat there alone. No,
not quite alone, for at the Captain's right sat the prettiest
girl I have ever seen. We met her the first day out, and
it was not long before she had attached herself to our
party. Peter, always susceptible to beauty, caused me
not a few pangs of jealousy before the trip was over.
And Miss Mercedes Howell, for such was her mismated
name, seemed to find much in common with my husband.
She had thought at first, she confided to me na&iuml;vely,
that the Doctor and I must be brother and sister despite
the passenger list, and at all events, we must have been
married a long, long time&mdash;was it not so, dear Mrs.
Denton?</p>

<p>On my stately assurance that I had been married less
than a week, her enormous black eyes flew open to their
widest. I changed the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Howell, so her vivacious chatter informed us,
was returning to Havana after a period of college. I
gathered that by the edict of the faculty she had gone
through Vassar in two years instead of the prescribed
four.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it was dull," she told us at the table, with
melting, melancholy eyes. "No young men! Nothing!
Just stupid books and rules&mdash;rules&mdash;rules!! It was
like prison! Imagine!"</p>

<p>And she looked brightly about the board for sympathy.
If I had a momentary sense of sympathy, it was for the
faculty, but evidently my husband and the Captain felt
otherwise.</p>

<p>Mercedes, as she insisted I should call her, extending
the courtesy to the entire family, and, as a matter of
course, addressing me as Mavis and the remainder of
the party as Peter and Bill, was the daughter of a
wealthy American, settled in Cuba with a Spanish wife.
She was twenty, and on returning to Cuba, was to make
her debut. I was tremendously interested by her vivid
account of Cuban Society, and went to bed each night
with my head a whirl of horse races, and parties and
country clubs and motor trips.</p>

<p>Her chaperone being confined to her cabin, Mercedes
found that, after I had retired it was quite providential
that she should keep "Billy" pleasantly occupied on
deck until such time as she should elect to go to bed.
I must say that my husband advanced no serious objections.
And when we parted on the docks at Havana,
Mercedes escaped from her wan and weary attendant
long enough to assure us all of her undying affection and
to impart to us the pleasing information that Guayabal,
whither we were bound, was quite near Havana, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
we could expect to see her often. I am afraid I was
not very cordial. She was rather a dear, and superlatively,
almost superfluously, pretty, but she made my
head ache, and beside her youth and effervescence I felt
curiously old.</p>

<p>Entering the harbor was something I shall never forget.
The blue water and the sun on the white and mauve
and pink houses, and the shining fortress of Morro castle
rising up from the bay. Bill told me something of
its history, as we leaned over the rail and watched the
approach. And a sense of horror took hold of me, in
the warmth and sunlight, as I thought of the torture
chamber and the silenced screams of the prisoners....</p>

<p>And that is why, I suppose, my first impression of
Cuba was one of beauty and cruelty, warmth and color
and the dark, swift treachery of by-gone ages.</p>

<p>The landing, the inspection, the docks, passed in a blur.
Sarah, pale and miserable, sat on a trunk with Peter
and watched her alien surroundings with unfriendly
eyes. But it was not long before we were hustled away
and into a long, luxurious open car, driven by a lean,
hawk-eyed person who greeted us in an unmistakable
Yankee twang, bless him, and seemed unfeignedly glad
to see us.</p>

<p>"This is Silas, Mavis," my husband informed me,
"chauffeur extraordinary, Jack-of-all-trades, and overseer-in-particular
to my friend, Harry Reynolds. And
this, Silas," he said, quite impressively, "is Mrs. Denton!"</p>

<p>I shook hands and presented Sarah, who brightened
visibly at the home-touch, and after we were settled, with
Peter and Wiggles and innumerable bags stowed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
front seat with Silas, I drew a deep breath and watched
Havana slide by, gay with color, its narrow streets
crowded, under a heavenly blue sky.</p>

<p>We ran along the low sea-wall, and passing parks and
wonderful stone edifices which seemed too fairy-like to
be called houses, we were soon leaving the outskirts far
behind us. Before us stretched a long, wide, white
road, thick with fine, sharp dust.</p>

<p>"We're climbing," said my husband, "you'll notice
the change of air soon, for Guayabal is in a mountain
district."</p>

<p>I hardly heard him. I was too busy watching the
various family groups as we went through the villages.
It was all so incongruous: here, a marvellous house
that might have belonged to some foreign Prince&mdash;there,
huddled at its very gate, a cluster of huts, thatched, and
sun-baked; and brown babies all over the landscape,
very naked, very dirty and, from a distance at least,
wholly enchanting. And then the trees! The tall, royal
palms, with the afternoon wind in them!</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" I said, as we passed a clump of wonderful
scarlet blossoms, "what is it?"</p>

<p>Sarah was exclaiming too, sitting perfectly upright and
rigid beside me.</p>

<p>"Hibiscus," answered our companion. "You'll find
lots of it where we are going."</p>

<p>The villages went by. A crimson sun was glowing
over the palms, and almost before I had seen it, it was
gone, and a violet after-glow was coloring distant hilltops.
I clasped my hands in my lap and wondered if
ever there had been anything as lovely and remote.
And it was with a sense of absolute shock that I heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
and saw Silas snap on the lights of the car and realized
that now the after-glow had gone and that the heavy
Southern night had closed in around us.</p>

<p>"Why, there isn't any twilight," I said, in childish disappointment.</p>

<p>"Not here," answered my husband, "Nature strikes
suddenly and swiftly in the tropics. She has no halftones,
no compromise...."</p>

<p>Even in the dark I could feel his glance at me. I said
nothing.</p>

<p>When we entered the village of Guayabal and drove
up the winding roadway through the gates and into the
drive, the stars were shining. Very close they seemed,
and tremendous&mdash;"as big as dinner plates," as Sarah
put it to me afterwards, with obvious disapproval. And
they were warm, almost fragrant, I fancied, unlike our
cold, high, impersonal stars of the North. They frightened me....</p>

<p>The lights shone out from a low, long house as the
car stopped under a portico. Two smiling Chinese
housemen were standing, ready to take our bags, and my
heart sank as I thought of what Sarah&mdash;who contributes
so religiously to foreign missions&mdash;must be thinking. It
was with relief, therefore, that I saw the unmistakable
Hibernian face of the cook at the door. The domestic
staff consisted then, of Wing and Fong and Norah; and
I blessed the Reynolds, that, in assembling their household
Lares and Penates, they had included something
white and clean and very cordial to preside over the
kitchen, for I feared for Sarah's peace of mind....</p>

<p>Peter, tired and perhaps somewhat frightened by the
strangeness and by the yellow hands raised to lift him
down from the car, whimpered a little, and my husband,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
jumping out, took the child in his arms and turned to
me,</p>

<p>"Welcome," he said, with a certain dignity, "to the
Palms."</p>

<p>It was the loveliest house. Even Sarah was moved
to favorable comment, and Wiggles went quite mad.
We entered through a screened, tile-floored verandah,
lamp-lighted, and bright with wicker-ware, to an enormous
room. The walls were panelled in dark wood, the
floor red-tiled, the ceiling raftered, and it was wide and
high and long beyond my wildest dreams of any room.
There were tables and books and myriad comfortable
chairs all about, and at the far end, a huge fireplace,
wherein a little red fire burned comfortably. For as the
night came, so came the sudden amazing chill after the
day's heat, and I found the warmth and sight of the fire
very gratifying. The room was living and dining room
in one, Norah explained to me, and showed me hard by
the pantry door, the table laid for two. And after my
first curiosity had subsided, she took me to my room.</p>

<p>It was many-windowed, and all the windows were
barred. Three red steps led up to the alcove where a
great bed was set, under an age-old crucifix. And it was
gay with chintz and dimities, while against my windows
a bourginvilla vine whispered in the wind.</p>

<p>Peter and Sarah were next door, with a bath between,
and across the way, my stranger-husband had his own
room and bath, as big and odd and delightful as mine.
I could hardly sit down or let Sarah brush my hair or
even wash the dust of the journey from me for excitement.</p>

<p>Peter, soon undressed and sitting up in bed with a big
bowl of bread and milk, was trying heroically to keep his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
eyes open. I heard his prayer, answered half a thousand
questions as best I could, left him sleeping quietly, and
went in search of my&mdash;host.</p>

<p>I found him, in a dinner jacket, at the piano, playing
something very softly, and with his eyes half-closed.
When he heard my step on the tiles, he jumped up.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you played," I said politely, glad that
Sarah had persuaded me to change, and conscious of
how very becoming the new mauve voile must be.</p>

<p>"I have a number of accomplishments," he answered
irritatingly.</p>

<p>I stood for a moment, by the fireplace, the mantel high
above my head.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful house," I said, trying to make
conversation. "Tell me something about it."</p>

<p>Dr. Denton drew two big chairs close to the fire and
for half an hour told me of his friend, Harry Reynolds,
and his delicate little wife, of how they had come to
Cuba and built this place of dreams and sent for Silas
from Vermont to come and take care of it.</p>

<p>"It is only about a hundred acres," said my companion,
"mostly in sugar cane. But Reynolds has plenty of
money and they were very happy here. When the
youngest boy died of fever, Mrs. Reynolds couldn't stand
it any longer. The place had too many associations. So
they left, last summer, keeping the servants on, for Harry
had to make several flying trips back and forth. And he
was glad to let us have the house for a time, until he decided
what to do with it. His wife swears she will never
come here again: and yet, they are reluctant to sell it. I
have spent a number of happy holidays here and so ...
well, it was all most opportune and providential ...
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
and I am convinced that the climate will be admirable
for you."</p>

<p>He was speaking in his professional tone, and I, nervous
and ill-at-ease, was glad to talk of my returning
health and of other prosaic matters.</p>

<p>"When you are rested," he said, "in a day or two, we
must go into Havana&mdash;you will want an account opened
there at one of the banks."</p>

<p>That reminded me of something that had been troubling
me.</p>

<p>"But it is not my money," I began rather abruptly, and
stopped.</p>

<p>"It is," he assured me, "Your father has been very
generous with you and you need feel under no obligations
to me&mdash;unless you object to having me play the
host a little until&mdash;later."</p>

<p>I didn't know what to answer, and blessed Fong's sleek
black head, as slippered and silent, he slid in to announce
dinner.</p>

<p>Norah had outdone herself for the "new Missis."
And it was pleasant in the softly lighted room, with the
candles burning on the table, shining across delicate old
china and worn silver.</p>

<p>My husband exerted himself to be amusing. Our talk
was all give and take, and there were even laughter awaking
echoes in the room.</p>

<p>Dinner over, after I had made a face over the strong
Cuban, and Bill&mdash;it was still so difficult to call him that&mdash;had
sent out word to Norah that hereafter we would
drink the sort of beverage I had been accustomed to,
he went to the piano again, and with a little snub-nosed
pipe between his teeth, sang ridiculous Bab ballads and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
played enchanting snatches of melody while, with Wiggles
on my lap, I dreamed before the fire.</p>

<p>Father would have loved it.... I missed him terribly.</p>

<p>The music stopped.</p>

<p>"Mavis...." he was beside me, something in his
hand. I turned, startled.</p>

<p>"I didn't give you a wedding present," he said, half-smiling,
"but before we left I had just time to have this
made for you."</p>

<p>I took the small, black leather case from his hand and
opened it. My father's face looked back at me, wonderfully
living. Almost it seemed as if the gentle, strong
mouth would smile and speak.</p>

<p>"I had it painted before&mdash;before the tide turned,"
said Bill, "from the picture he gave me."</p>

<p>I closed my hands upon the miniature and my eyes
against the tears.</p>

<p>"You are very good," I said falteringly. "I&mdash;you
couldn't have given me anything I could have cared for
more."</p>

<p>He stood, his broad shoulders squared against the
mantel, and looked at me gravely.</p>

<p>"I hope," he said and stopped. Then, very evenly, he
went on, "I hope you will try to be happy here, Mavis."</p>

<p>Happy! A sudden revulsion of feeling came over me.
What use had I for happiness? I had been almost stupefied,
like an animal in the sun, dreaming vaguely before
the fire. But now....</p>

<p>"I will try to be&mdash;content," I told him.</p>

<p>His eyes hardened, grew keen and cold again.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, not quite sincerely.</p>

<p>We were silent a moment, until Silas came in to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the orders for the following day. I hardly heard the
voices, talking so near me. It mattered so little what
they, or anyone, said. I thought of Green Hill, of Peter
asleep near me.... I thought of father, in his big
woods, his old strength coming back to him ... and I
thought of the letter that had reached me on my wedding
day ... my first love letter. I had not answered it.
For me, no "lyric hour" could exist. No, nor not even
the dream of one. Uncle John, I thought, would have
told Richard Warren by now that I was married. Mrs.
William Denton....</p>

<p>My thoughts blurred into a half-dream. I was on a
ship. Somewhere Mercedes Howell was standing. I
heard her calling from far off, "Billy, Billy!"</p>

<p>I awoke suddenly. Silas had gone and my husband
was standing near me,</p>

<p>"You called me, Mavis," he was saying.</p>

<p>I looked at him, at the great, strange room, confused
and half asleep.</p>

<p>"I was dreaming," I said, and then, "a nightmare."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" he laughed a little. "You look like a
child," he said slowly, "with the firelight on your yellow
hair and that flush in your cheeks."</p>

<p>I rose, tumbling Wiggles unceremoniously to the floor.</p>

<p>"Good-night," I said.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he answered, his hands deep in his
pockets, and then, as I turned, "Sleep well, my little
Make-Believe-Wife!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER X</p>

<p class="p2">I had been asleep for several hours, I fancy, that first
night in Cuba, when I awoke to see the moonlight, like a
living presence in my room. Across the floor it lay in
long, level bars of light. Not the iron barriers at my
window could keep it out. Silver it was, and never still,
but quivering as if a heart shook it. The scent of flowers
came to me, and far off in what was probably the native
quarter, I heard a throbbing instrument touched very
softly, and the sound of singing. It was all so strange,
I could scarcely believe myself awake. And presently,
in nightgown and bare feet, I went across the cool tiles
to the windows and looked out.</p>

<p>The earth was silver under my eyes and the tall palms
delicately feathered with light. The singing died away
to half a sob. The smell of growing things was heavy
and sweet on the air. It was all sheer beauty.</p>

<p>A little song began to weave itself in my brain. I had
made songs before: almost too shy to set down on paper
they were. But here, in Cuba, where everything seemed
softness and release, I wondered if perhaps I could not
sing with a stronger voice, and shape my songs with pen
and ink. What was it Richard Warren had said about
poets? And then, suddenly I knew that it was the
thought of him which had taken me out of sleep and sent
me trembling to the window, with my breast bare to the
wonderful night. I knew that, once and for all, all
beauty must be inextricably woven with the thought of
him who had signed himself my "lover."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that I became aware that something was
hurting me cruelly&mdash;something cold and hard and forbidding.
I crept back to bed with the marks of the bars
across my breast.</p>

<p>In the morning I woke to find Peter sitting crosslegged
on my bed saying solemnly,</p>

<p>"They're blue! They're grey! No, they're open and
they're brown!"</p>

<p>Wide awake now, I caught him to me, cuddled him
close and then asked wildly,</p>

<p>"Oh-h, Peter!&mdash;what's that?"</p>

<p>Not far from my window a raucous voice was saying,
"Bring me my coffee! Coffee! Norah! Hurry up!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's Uncle Bill!" said Peter, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Of course it isn't, Peter," I said quite crossly, and
climbed out of bed.</p>

<p>From my window, in the full, dazzling sunlight, I
could see where the kitchen made an L, and the
screened kitchen porch from which that terrifying voice
emanated.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" it was saying. "Gol dern! Coffee!
Coffee!"</p>

<p>"Why, Peter," I cried, "it's a macaw! A beauty!
I've never seen one before&mdash;only pictures! Hurry and
get dressed and let's go out and say good-morning to
him!"</p>

<p>Sarah, apparently at home, and certainly composed,
but rather too communicative as to the habits of
"heathen," appeared, to help me dress and to hustle Peter
into his own room. But before I was ready, a knock
came at the door, and on its heels, Norah, bearing fragrant
coffee and hot, brown rolls.</p>

<p>"Good morning, and it's never <i>up</i> ye are!" she said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
in astonishment, setting the tray down on a little table
which she spread with a white cloth.</p>

<p>"Doesn't one get up in Cuba?" I asked, laughing, as,
in a neglig&eacute;e, I sat down to my breakfast.</p>

<p>"Not yet," she answered, "it's coffee ye have in bed,
and then at eleven-thirty a real, big breakfast-lunch.
Tea's at four, and dinner's at eight&mdash;unless ye'd rather
it was different, ma'am," she added hastily.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I assured her, "I think it's a delightful
arrangement. When in Cuba...." I began gaily.</p>

<p>"Smoke Cubebs!" finished another voice, and my husband's
dark head appeared in the open doorway. "Good
morning, Mavis. How did you sleep?"</p>

<p>"Beautifully," I told him, just a little bit embarrassed
as his tall, bathrobed figure wandered unconcernedly in.</p>

<p>"Another cup," he said to Norah, with a side-glance at
me and a careless, "with your permission."</p>

<p>I nodded&mdash;I couldn't very well do anything else, with
Sarah there, and Norah beaming, and Peter dashing in
to shriek loudly for milk.</p>

<p>In the general tumult, the macaw had started again,</p>

<p>"Norah!" it squawked. "Coffee! Coffee!"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," I said, "what sophisticated sort
of a bird is that?"</p>

<p>"That's Arthur," said Norah proudly, and disappeared.
Later, I left Bill and Peter exchanging pleasantries over
the breakfast table and went to the kitchen porch to
watch Arthur being fed bread, lavishly sopped in coffee,
from a spoon. He was an utterly gorgeous bird, yellow
and blue, and "a great talker," as Norah informed me.
Me, however, he regarded for some time with a glassy
eye, and merely reiterated his desire for strong drink.</p>

<p>Returning, I found my room empty and closing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the door, proceeded, with mixed emotions, to dress.</p>

<p>Last night ... the moonlight and the surge of regret
and longing which had threatened to drown me, seemed
very far away. And it was mentally on tip-toe that I
joined a white flannelled Bill for my first stroll about
my temporary domain.</p>

<p>We were alone, Peter having long since appropriated
the services of Silas and gone forth with him to view the
country.</p>

<p>The sun was very hot, and I tilted my parasol low
over my face. Through avenues of palms we walked
to the big, red-roofed garage, and on to the little orange
grove behind the out-buildings. Beyond, the cane fields
stretched, green and tall and waving. Figures, stunted,
wiry, moved in the fields ... far off I saw a patient
donkey stand, his back loaded with long lengths of cane
tips. It was all hot and still, clear-cut and unreal to
look at.</p>

<p>Silas, Peter and one of the natives came toward us,
Peter rapt at the tremendous flow of Cuban-Spanish
which surged above his small blonde head. They stopped
to speak to us, Bill growing suddenly foreign and gesticulating
as he answered the bent brown man's
greetings.</p>

<p>"That's Juan," he told me, as we moved off. "Great
old character. He has a daughter whom he adores, a
girl who must be sixteen now, I should judge. He used
to beat her unmercifully...."</p>

<p>"Horrible creature!" I said, with a shudder, my mind
flashing back to that beautiful, sinister fortress rising,
towered, from the sea, a symbol and a reminder....</p>

<p>Bill pushed his panama back from his broad forehead
and whistled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," he said thoughtfully.... "After
all, he beat her to keep her good."</p>

<p>A peacock, tail unfurled, minced colorfully toward
us, down the white pathway.</p>

<p>"To keep her good!" I repeated scornfully, "with
whipping?"</p>

<p>"I'm not advocating it," he answered quickly, "but his
motives are unquestionably admirable. And there's a
Spanish proverb, you may recall&mdash;it runs, tersely, 'A
woman, a dog, and a chestnut-tree, the more you beat
them, the better they be!'"</p>

<p>Wiggles, his eyes on the stately departing peacock,
pranced down the path toward us, and, deflected by my
whistle from his original, doubtless destructive purpose,
leaped gaily at my ruffles.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, Wiggles?" I asked him. "This
is decidedly no place for you!"</p>

<p>But Wiggles, rolling happily in the grass, merely
snorted.</p>

<p>A gong sounded from the house, and we went in to
lunch.</p>

<p>About two o'clock, I was attacked by an overpowering
languor. Twice, no less, I yawned in Peter's face, in
the midst of his thrilling description of "babies an' ladies
an' gentlemen, all brown, Aunt Mavis!"</p>

<p>"Siesta, now!" remarked my husband briskly. "Both
of you! Off to bed!"</p>

<p>"Bed!" I said, "in the middle of the day!"
Peter, but recently released from the burden of an
afternoon nap, protested.</p>

<p>"Custom of the country," said Bill. "No getting
around it. Couldn't if you wanted to. Even Arthur is
asleep."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>I listened. We were on the verandah, and all about
us was a stillness which was almost audible. On the
white road beyond our gates I saw a pair of oxen, toiling
patiently up the hill. Even the birds were quiet, only
now and then a sleepy chirping drifted down the hot air.
It seemed as if a veil had been drawn over the land.
My eyelids felt freighted, and I was very tired.</p>

<p>"Bed!" said Bill firmly.</p>

<p>I left Peter to his tender mercies and went indoors.
My room was cool, and sweet with flower perfume.
Sarah, yawning, came when I rang, and unhooked my
frock. As I lay down on the bed, I heard her say something,
bitterly, about "an unhealthy climate," but if she
said more, I do not know what it was, for I was fast and
dreamlessly asleep.</p>

<p>It was Arthur who woke me, making the day hideous
with his laughter. "Mother's darling!" he announced,
unctuously. "Pretty Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!"</p>

<p>I turned over and felt for my watch. Four o'clock!
It was incredible. And equally beyond belief, the fact
that I was hungry again!</p>

<p>I bathed and dressed, and then, wonderfully rested,
went out on the verandah. Fong and Wing appeared
as if by magic and laid the tea-table with iced tea, tiny
round tomato sandwiches, and delectable frosted cakes.
And also, as if answering some compelling summons,
Peter, bright-eyed and red-cheeked, strolled out from the
direction of Bill's room. It was quite apparent that both
of them had been asleep.</p>

<p>"Tea?" I asked my husband, as his tall figure loomed
up behind Peter.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" he said. "It's a necessity in Cuba, not
a mere excuse for sociability."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>All about us the birds were singing again, and the
palms looked new washed.</p>

<p>"It looks as if it had rained," I said in amazement.</p>

<p>"Probably has," said Bill lazily, "Often does afternoons."</p>

<p>What a country!</p>

<p>That night, I made my first little song. There was a
thought somewhere, back in my brain, a thought of moonlight
and bars and a far-off singing. But it was not clear
yet. So, instead, I set to paper the first eight lines that
Cuba had made for me.</p>

<div class="poem p2">

<p class="i6"><i>Fantasie</i></p>

<p>The palms are listening to Pan<br />
<span class="i1">Across the Terrace of the Night,</span>
<span class="i1">A Peacock-Moon, aloof and white,</span>
<span class="i0">Spreads wide a silver fan.</span></p>

<p>The gilded stars with laughter pass,<br />
<span class="i1">For I have caught an eerie sound,</span>
<span class="i1">The Peacock droops ... just now, I found</span>
<span class="i0">A silver feather in the grass!</span></p></div>

<p class="p2">And so the days passed in blur of color and scent: of
sun and sleep.</p>

<p>Peter grew tanned, and so did I. It was life in a fairy
tale, and would have seemed quite perfect&mdash;if&mdash;. But
I had grown to believe that nothing was ever perfect.
Perhaps it were wise so, else we should all be loath even
more to leave life. And the rift in the lute could not
wholly ruin the music.</p>

<p>We had been there a week, I imagine, before Mercedes
Howell descended upon us. She came apparelled marvellously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
in a highly horse-powered chariot, and brought
with her, as was eminently proper, her parents.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howell, n&eacute;e Dolores Maria Cortez, was that pathetic
thing, a woman who had once been very beautiful.
It was not hard to trace that beauty now, in the high,
clean-cut nose, the great languid eyes, the tiny, full, red
mouth. But her beauty was clouded with flesh, and her
face a mask of powder. She sat on the verandah drinking
"pina fria," with her tiny, arched feet on a footstool,
and murmured polite accented thanks for the care
we had taken of her dear child. I glanced at Bill, over
a tray of cakes, but he was looking at Mercedes. So I
turned, with a quickened heartbeat, to Mr. Howell. I
found him charming, a tall, silent man, brown from the
sun, and very lined. He listened eagerly, I fancied, to
my chatter of home and snow and the quiet ebb and flow
of life in a New England village. But Cuba had marked
him for her own. One saw that. And one saw, too, his
restless eyes moving from wife to daughter, questioning
and troubled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howell, before she left, asked us to some day attend
the races with her. I told her I was not well, not
yet up to the excitement of crowds.... But Bill, looking
up quickly from his low-voiced conversation with
Mercedes, said,</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can persuade Mrs. Denton, dear lady. It
is something she surely should not miss."</p>

<p>Our glances met&mdash;crossed blades and stayed. Mine
was hurt, I know. It was cruel of him, in that insufferably
self-assured tone, to brush aside my wishes. When
our guests had gone, I told him so.</p>

<p>"But," he said, at the doorway, "what you need more
than anything, is contact with people, and to be taken out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
of yourself. You have never seen anything of the sort
before, and you will not have the opportunity again. And
the Howells are very good people to tie up to. They have
lived here many years and have not wholly discarded the
picturesque viewpoints and customs of the country, while
at the same time, entering into the life of the American
set."</p>

<p>"I didn't come here for society," I said, "and I don't
want to be bothered ... by anyone. Go alone to the races,
if you will, but I shall not."</p>

<p>He shrugged.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said.</p>

<p>Two days later, Bill drove the car into Havana, where
he joined the Howells in a luncheon party and went afterwards
to the races with them. I wondered if they would
not think it very strange ... under the circumstances. And
then I reflected that an extra man, married or bachelor, is
welcome almost anywhere. And during my brief betrothal
Bill had declared himself "quite free."</p>

<p>I didn't care, of course, where he went or with whom.
It was none of my business. And it was the loneliness and
the longing for things that could never be mine, which
oppressed me and made me spend my sleepless afternoon
siesta on a tear-damp pillow.</p>

<p>When Bill came home that night, I harkened politely to
his account of his outing, and then went early to my room.
The poem which had made itself mine during my first
night in Cuba was clamoring to be written. And so I
wrote it, at my table under the window, conscious that no
words in so unskilled a hand could set down my feeling of
imprisonment and regret.</p>

<p>Finished, I laid it in the drawer where my diary and the
letters from Richard Warren were. It was a childish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
thing, but I had made it, and it belonged to me ... and
to one other.</p>

<div class="poem p2">

<p>The moonlight slips in silence through the bars,<br />
<span class="i1">The iron bars which lend a strange romance</span>

<p>I closed the drawer&mdash;spent, unsatisfied. The thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
was halting and superficial. It did not seem possible that
there were people who could find release in words, or
peace in beauty.</p>

<p>I had not reread Richard Warren's letters since my
marriage. And this was a night I dared not read them,
for all that my resolve weakened. For, in some inexplicable
way, he had become very real to me&mdash;in Cuba. And
I knew that he could not be anyone save himself, could
not be anything save strong and fine and understanding.</p>

<p>I took my trouble into Peter's room and sat with it for
a long time, by his bedside. But it was Dawn, before,
in my cool, deep alcove, I had ceased tossing and slept.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XI</p>

<p class="p2">A week slipped by before we returned the Howells'
call. Then, one brilliant morning, I drove with Bill
into Havana and together we transacted some embarrassing
monetary business at the bank. After which I expressed
a desire to go shopping. The sidewalks were
quite impassable: so narrow that, for the most part, the
pedestrians, unhurried, strolled in the hardly wider
streets. The shops held me, fascinated. And I was not
a little annoyed at the manner in which Bill conducted
my purchases&mdash;here a gorgeous feather fan, there a
piece of lace: and in another spot a deadly and lovely
bit of Toledo workmanship, executed with rare finesse
on the hilt of a stiletto. Yet, I too, was determined not
to return to Green Hill without a trunk laden with gifts
for my dear people there. Once, I slipped away from my
husband, who was deep in conversation ... of a political
nature, judging from the volubility of the shop-keeper
who engaged his attention ... and, entering a store
some five or six houses away, I tried out my absurd and
garbled knowledge of Spanish, with terrifying results.
For the little lady who guarded the delicate linens flooded
me with such an impressive flow of wholly unintelligible
syllables, that, baffled, I beat an ignominious retreat, followed
by her to the very door. On the street I met
Bill, hatless and disturbed out of all proportion.</p>

<p>"Please never do that again, Mavis," he commanded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
taking my arm. "I am not willing to have you roam the
streets of Havana alone."</p>

<p>I drew my arm away.</p>

<p>"I am quite capable of taking care of myself," I said
with frigidity, "especially in broad daylight."</p>

<p>"This is not Green Hill," he answered enigmatically,
"nor yet New York."</p>

<p>I started to reply, but a glance from a passing dark-eyed
individual, immaculately attired in white, quelled
me. I had never before encountered anything quite so
sweeping, so totally inventorying, so insolent. I had the
immediate sensation that I was in one of those nightmare
dreams, in which one walks upon a public highway, quite
unclothed. Unconsciously, I cast a reassuring glance at
my lavender linen, and breathed again. I must have
gasped, for Bill looked from my blazing cheeks to the
wayfaring gentleman. Something belligerent came into
his eyes, and then he looked into mine, lifting his brows.</p>

<p>"You see?" he remarked.</p>

<p>It was plain that I had seen. I said nothing, but hastened
my steps.</p>

<p>"Where did you leave your hat?" I asked sweetly.</p>

<p>We retrieved the object and went to where we had
left the car, driving to a restaurant, high over the harbor,
where, on the second floor, we lunched deliciously, on
palatable creatures sinisterly named Morro crabs, and
other delicacies. A gun boat lay, far off, at rest on the
blue waters, and here and there the black funnels of
steamers lifted darkly against a burning sky. People at
neighboring tables bowed to my companion. Several
came over to us and were presented to me: a ruddy-faced
Englishman, of military bearing, and with an ineffable air
of detachment from his surroundings: a member of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
American Legation, a lean, bearded man, with an unamerican
name and a dark face, reminding me of an
ancient Spanish nobleman whose picture I had once seen:
a fair-haired, attractive boy, and others whom I have
forgotten. And the meal could hardly have been termed
a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. I was heartily glad of it.</p>

<p>Until the calling hour came, we amused ourselves with
a survey of the crowded districts of the city. An appalling
number of tourists passed and repassed us, obviously
bent on the same idle occupation. Pretty girls
in bright sweaters and tennis-shoes: fat mothers, similarly
clad: and patient, bored men, silent or loquacious, chewing
black Cuban cigars, following their women folk in
and out the shops. And on the broader thoroughfares,
I saw the Cuban women driving in open victorias, powdered
and wonderfully dressed, regarding the "touristen"
with slightly cynical, always beautiful, eyes.</p>

<p>The Howells' great house, a stone structure on the
Vadado, was a revelation of formal and chilling luxury.
As we waited for Mrs. Howell to come to us in the drawing-room,
Bill murmured under his breath,</p>

<p>"'I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls!' Isn't it amazing?"</p>

<p>Before I could answer, our hostess swept in, accompanied,
almost preceded, by an overpowering wave of
perfume. I had no time to reply, but found myself
nodding at him in sympathetic appreciation. All through
the somewhat stilted conversation which followed, the
stately tea, and the meteoric appearance of Mercedes, as
chatty and brilliant as some tropical bird, I seemed to
cling to the solidity and confident familiarity of my husband
as the one real thing in an unreal room.</p>

<p>But, leaving, I was forced to confess to myself the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
real friendliness and cordiality of these alien people towards
me, a stranger at their imposing gates.</p>

<p>It was Mercedes who explained to me that the feminine
quality of Havana did not go a-shopping in sport
clothes.</p>

<p>"You would not do it," she said, "on your Fifth
Avenue. We do not do it here. It is not the custom.
We wear our smartest gowns and our highest-heeled
shoes."</p>

<p>She made an entrancing little moue at the thought of
sweaters and rubber soles. And, with a feeling of commiseration
toward my comfortably sport-clad compatriots,
dashing through Havana streets, lavish of exclamation and
of purse I was foolishly glad that something had
prompted me to look my coolest and prettiest before
setting forth on the expedition.</p>

<p>I remember that day well, for it was on the same evening,
back once more in the palm-enclosed gardens of my
new home, that Juan, the native workman appeared,
shortly after dinner, a broad-brimmed hat clutched to his
sunken chest, his face working oddly, demanding to speak
to the doctor.</p>

<p>I heard scattered words&mdash;"fiebre" and "agonia," and
the name "Annunciata" repeated again and again. And,
finally, when Bill rose with a quiet, brief sentence, I
caught a long-drawn "ah-h" and "Dios! muchisimas
gracias, Senor!" from the old man.</p>

<p>"Juan's daughter is ill," Bill told me quickly. "I'm
going with him. Shan't be long. Go to bed, Mavis, you
look done up. It's been a long day."</p>

<p>Stopping only to get his hat and an emergency case,
he was gone with the excited, anxious old man, and I was
alone in the big room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>Something he had said to me, far back in what now
seemed the past ages, came to me vaguely, something
about the "poetry of healing." And I pondered upon it
for a long time, till a falling log roused me, and I went
to bed. But not until I heard a familiar step on the path
did I consider sleeping. I slipped on a neglig&eacute;e and went
to my door. He was coming toward me, tired, I thought,
and troubled.</p>

<p>"Bill!" I called softly.</p>

<p>He stopped a moment, peering into the dim light which
streamed through the half-open door into the narrow, long
hall which separated our rooms.</p>

<p>"Mavis!" and then, reproachfully. "Why aren't you
in bed?"</p>

<p>"You've been gone hours," I said, conscious of a childish
petulance. "How is she?"</p>

<p>With a hand on the latch of his own door, he considered
me. I must have looked a sight, half-asleep, my hair in
braids down my thinly-clad back. But if he thought so,
he did not say it.</p>

<p>"All right now," he answered. "But she was a pretty
sick girl. And, of course, they had applied home-made
remedies, liberally sprinkled with superstition! It looked
like a case of ptomaine to me. Anyway, she'll be on the
road to recovery&mdash;and more beatings&mdash;tomorrow. It
was," he concluded with a smile, "a rather disconcerting
evening. Half a dozen people praying all over the place,
and, when I left, kissing my hands! Lucky I've had
some experience in dealing with the natives before
this."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," I said. "Poor old Juan!"</p>

<p>"It was nice of you to wait up," said Bill suddenly.
"Thanks!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>I became acutely conscious of the hour and of my appearance.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was interested," I said lamely.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," he answered, a smile lighting up his
worn face, "it's not often that you&mdash;honor me."</p>

<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to reply, "my interest is
solely in old Juan and his daughter." But I didn't. It
didn't seem quite fair, and wasn't strictly true.</p>

<p>"Good-night," I said, withdrawing, "I'm glad she's all
right."</p>

<p>From his closing door his words floated back to me,</p>

<p>"<i>Buenas noches, cara mia!</i>"</p>

<p>Annunciata recovered, and to Sarah's outspoken disapproval
I had her come often to the house. She sewed
excellently, and embroidered even better, and I was glad
to be able to give her small odds and ends of work to do.
She was a lovely thing: rounded, and supple, with a clear,
creamy-brown skin. But chancing one day to observe
her mother on the road below the house I was smitten with
a prophetic horror for Annunciata's future. For the
woman, who could not have been more than thirty-five
was as bent and gnarled as a Northerner of sixty, wrinkled
like a monkey and with something of that creature's
patient, if malicious wisdom in her eyes. I began
to realize that Juan, too was according to our standards
a man still in his early prime. I was confused by such an
ordering of Nature. I said something of this to Bill but
he only answered, knocking the ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p>"Southern fruit ripens quickly."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem fair," I said, rebelliously, thinking of
Annunciata and her slow, indolent grace. At sixteen I&mdash;but
perhaps I was not a good example.</p>

<p>"Our girls are children at sixteen," I told him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>"You are a child at&mdash;what is it&mdash;twenty-two," he
answered.</p>

<p>I did not pursue the personal application further. But
it was not right that this young thing should be a woman
so soon, and so shortly destined to be old. Youth&mdash;and
Age. There are no timid blossomings, no gracious gradations
in the South.</p>

<p>We were, very quietly, rather gay those days. I had
been several times to luncheon at the Country Club and
had met a number of delightful Americans there. It was
all very new and exciting. And so invariably beautiful!
And I was absurdly glad that Bill ranked very high in the
estimation of the other men, as a golfer. Watching remnants
of the game from the long, wide Club-porch, I was
astounded by the seriousness with which grown men pursued
an innocuous white ball for miles and miles of green
turf. Once, in the late afternoon, together with a party
of several women including Mercedes Howell, I followed
a match game for a time. The exotic view, the stunted
palms, the small lizards that ran almost from under our
feet, animate emeralds, the glimpse of blue water from
a hill, enthralled me. But I think that the small, black
or tan boys who carried the clubs and who bet their prospective
fees with whole-hearted enthusiasm on the respective
merits of their employers amused me more than anything
I had ever seen. And it was of course solely from
sympathy with my husband's ebony attendant that I knew
a certain triumph, when, long after we women had tired
and returned to the club-house, the men came in, hot and
shrieking for cool drinks, proclaiming Bill as victor. He
had "saved the game by supernatural putting" his partner,
the fair haired boy I had met in the Havana restaurant,
announced enviously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>"You should be proud of him," he added, sitting down
beside me.</p>

<p>"I am," I said dutifully.</p>

<p>Bill, en route to a mysterious thing called a locker,
paused to cast a mirthful look at me, and quite against my
will I laughed. I am certain that the blond one, who answered
to the name of Bobby Willard, thought me demented.</p>

<p>A number of people called upon us almost every day,
motoring out for luncheon or tea. Our little household
ran smoothly, and happily. Sarah and Nora gradually
became excellent friends, and, evenings, I would often
hear Silas's low voice in the kitchen, and going in to consult
Nora, would surprise his lean form, sprawled in a
kitchen chair, two legs of it off the floor, smoking his
inevitable cigar, a coffee-cup at his elbow. To Wing and
Fong, Sarah, to my astonishment, perceptibly unbent. It
was apparent that the two silent little Asiatics regarded
her with admiration and awe. Bill suggested that she
was doubtless trying to convert them. But I could not
believe that!</p>

<p>Peter was perhaps, the most whole-heartedly happy of
any of us. Never very far from Silas's side, he assumed
a lordly dictatorship over the natives, and picked up an
amazing amount of Spanish, in his excursions about the
plantation. Silas taught him to ride, too, on a lean little
Cuban horse, and would ride out with him, in the early
mornings, tremendously amused at the grave manner in
which Peter would return the white-toothed salutations
of the passersby. In those days, also, I elected to oversee
Peter's neglected education, and, with more ambition than
efficiency, would devote the half hour before his supper
time to teaching him to read. Bill, with his pipe and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
newspaper, would attend these sessions, from a far corner
of the room. And I could not refrain from reflecting
how, to an unenlightened observer, very domestic we
would appear. That the thought had not escaped Bill,
too, was apparent by a remark he made one evening.
Coming to the mantel-piece, he looked at the two of us
for some time, and said,</p>

<p>"You make a charming picture, you two children.
Exemplary," he added with a smile.</p>

<p>I made no comment, but bent lower over the page on
which the pregnant legend, "This is a cat," appeared
in large letters, flanking an appropriate illustration.</p>

<p>Those were days, even, and uneventful in the larger
sense. There were varying episodes, incidents, which
however did not break into the continuity of a life that
seemed a half-waking dream. Once, I went fishing with
Bill and Bobby Willard. It was pleasant, drifting over
the peacock-blue waters, and of our not inconsiderable
catch nothing remains in my memory save the almost unnatural
beauty of certain gorgeous fish, colored red and
blue and purple, with little sail-like fins.</p>

<p>I had my first swimming lesson in many years, at that
time too. And the picture of the beach, the feel of the
velvet-soft, brilliantly blue water, the laughing people and
the many children, stayed with me for a long time. At
my second dip, I actually swam three strokes, not, however,
without Bill's solidly protective arm. He swam
magnificently himself. Mercedes Howells, transformed
into a most seductive mermaid by a bright green bathing
suit, was most outspoken in her admiration.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful figure," she said, in a wholly audible
aside to me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>I was forced to agree, but swallowed a good deal more
water than was comfortable in the process.</p>

<p>Bill, in spite of his vigorous exploits in the water,
seemed content to spend most of his swimming hour with
Peter and me. But after he had sent us to the bathing
pavilion to dress, he swam far out to join Mercedes, and
when I came from my cubicle again, they were just coming
out of the water together, a splendidly matched pair,
laughing, vital. A curious languor came over me as I
watched them walking across the beach.</p>

<p>"You're tired," said Bill, dripping before me.</p>

<p>"A little," I admitted.</p>

<p>So after that, I swam rarely. The ride in from Guayabal
was long and tiring. And once or twice a week, I
stayed at home, while Bill went forth in the motor, to
golf and swim, coming back in time for dinner.</p>

<p>I was never bored. There were letters from Father to
answer: a difficult diplomatic task; letters too, from the
Goodriches, who were dashing about the Continent at a
breath-taking speed. Peter had half an album filled with
postcards before his parents had been on the other side
two weeks! And of course I had to take innumerable
snapshots with the little kodak Bill bought me in Havana,
in order to pictorially report Peter's progress. Uncle
John wrote often, sometimes to Bill, sometimes to me,
and now and then to us both jointly. The advent of the
mail was a real joy. No one seemed to forget us, everyone
demanded an immediate reply. And it was difficult
not to put off letter writing until the morrow. For I had
not been in Cuba more than twenty-eight hours before
the "manana philosophy" had laid hold of me.</p>

<p>In my secret drawer a little pile of poems grew. I was
amazed at the way the songs came to me, sang in my brain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and would not be still until I had put them on paper. In
my heart, I harbor a timid ambition of one day showing
them to Uncle John. If he would publish them, privately,
I could send a copy to Richard Warren. After all&mdash;they
were his: his and Cuba's and mine own.</p>

<p>Between tea and dinner, the days when Bill was not
at home, I would walk. Sometimes with little Peter,
or with Annunciata, sometimes alone, save for little
Wiggles. Little by little I grew to know the natives
by name and station: went, even into their one-roomed
houses, dark and smoky, thatched with palm
leaves, and odorous with charcoal stoves. One amusing
acquaintance I made was that of old Manuel, who
lived not for from our gates. Annunciata took me
there, affirming that of all the Guayablan sights, this
was one I must not miss. Bill was horrified to hear of
my call at Manuel's pitifully poor dwelling. But he
went there himself later, to see if in any way, he
could alleviate the very obvious poverty and probable
suffering of the ancient creature. For the tradition
had it that Manuel was one hundred and twenty years
old. Certain it was that he remembered Havana when
it was little more than a cow-pasture. Age had shrunken
him to the stature of a child, but his eye were still
bright, his features cleancut, his grey hair and beard
still curling and vigorous. The village people took a
certain pride in their ancient, and he did not lack for
visitors. Propped up on a make-shift bed, wrapped in
rags, from which his bare thin legs protruded, he received
me with great dignity. And we talked for fully
half an hour: that is to say, Annunciata talked, and
Manuel talked, and now and then the former would
translate a phrase or two into her scanty English. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
was from Bill, however, that I heard most of the old
man's story.</p>

<p>It was on one of my solitary excursions that the sudden
night surprised me, a quarter of a mile from home. The
smoke-blue rim of mountains grew black and menacing,
and the song of the light winds in the palms turned to a
sinister whispering. With Wiggles at my hurrying heels,
I fairly fled through the night, ashamed of my unreasoning
terror. A group of Rurales, the native soldiers,
passed me with a clatter of hoofs. Later, a bare-footed
native, riding saddleless, singing in a curious, eerie monotone,
to ward off the evil spirits, rode slowly by. There
was a heavy perfume in the air, and a young moon swung
delicately into view. But I had no heart for beauty, and
almost stumbling into the hedge of Spanish Bayonets
which fringed our property, I came through the open
gates into the light from the house, with a half-sob of
relief, and an exceedingly youthful fear of justifiable
chastisement. But it was some ten minutes after I had
come home, that I heard the car, with Bill at the wheel,
swing up to the portico. That evening, discussing the
past day, I refrained from mentioning my little adventure.
For it was an adventure, mysterious, strange, and somehow
terrifying.</p>

<p>The evenings were pleasant. We read a great deal,
aloud, and I was surprised to find my husband no mean
critic, widely read, and with keen appreciation. We
sat, always before the fire, and much of the time I would
forget to listen to the sense of the words, hearing only
the sound of the attractive, flexible voice, and watching
the flames on the big hearth. I never wearied of that.
There was a wonderful poem in the logs, flowering blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
and rose, gold and scarlet: charring to white and red,
which seemed like some extraordinary fungus-growth:
singing and flickering, intensely alive in disintegration.</p>

<p>And so the days drew into March, and still we lingered.
Bill, persuaded by neighbors that even May was bearable
in Cuba, spoke of staying at least until the middle of
April. I did not care. Father was still in Canada, and
Green Hill would have been empty without him. It was
a Lotus-eater's life and I was content. The sight of the
great, purple orchids, fragile and almost unbelievably
beautiful, clinging to the palm-trees, was enough to keep
me happy for a whole day. To look from the windows
through the luxuriance of the bourginvilla vines to the
golden-freighted orange-trees was a rare delight. To see
the cane-fields in the wind, the hibiscus under a noon sun,
the peacocks pacing the white walks before sunset, was to
live a poem. If, now and then, on still nights, a restlessness
and nostalgia for something keener, sharper, something
unnamable and unknown, would seize me, it would
vanish again before the breathless, expectant dawn. And,
if one grew melancholy, there was always Arthur to turn
to&mdash;a bird, philosophic and unexpected, who had developed
a feud with Wiggles. To watch the two of them,
Arthur resplendent and mocking on his perch, Wiggles,
a black lump of outrage dashing up and down before the
door of the wire cage, which was as big as a small room,
was a sight to dispel dull care. And from someone,
Arthur had learned endearing names. "Pretty darling!"
he would articulate, his head flirtatiously to one side, his
beady eyes fixed on mine, his claw extended with quite the
grand manner. And, when, nettled by his tone, I would
advance to the cage, he would slide off to the other end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
his perch and demand bleakly, "Coffee! Gol dern!
Bow wow wow!" a climax that never failed to arouse
Wiggles to frenzy.</p>

<p>And so, between beauty and laughter, firelight and sunshine,
we trod, all unknowing, perilously close to tragedy.

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XII</p>

<p class="p2 i10"><span class="smcap">Cactus</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
Twisted, deformed, and stretching thorny hands<br />
To mock the golden beauty of the South<br />
Embodied Evil, set in glowing lands<br />
Like some black curse within a lovely mouth,<br />
The sullen cactus, lone and brooding, stands.<br />
Yet Earth, All-Just, All-Wise, All-Tender, deems<br />
Her crippled offspring worthy still to bear<br />
The crown of perfect blossoms: as beseems,<br />
Some dark misshapen souls, in secret wear<br />
The splendid Flower of their silent Dreams!<br /></p>

<p class="p2">It was, of course, the tall cactus, to the left of the
house, which set me to singing. For a long time it had
affronted me. Pallid, sickly, abnormal, flowering suddenly
into crimson blossom, it was for me, an actual blot
on the lovely landscape gardening of the Palms. But one
day I said something of this to Bill, and he said,</p>

<p>"It may start out in ugliness, but it's rooted in strength
and ends in beauty, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>This gave me "furiously to think." In an early letter
to me, Richard Warren had said something very much the
same, not, however, apropos of cactus plants. And here
was my matter-of-fact, mocking husband preaching the
same doctrine of "beauty everywhere." After that, I
tried to make friends with the uncouth cactus, and, as so
often happens, grew quite attached to it. Nights, it stood
like a sentinel ghost, its deformities softened, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
flowers courageous and gay in the moonlight. My growing
sense of comradeship with Bill was materially increased
at that half-minute remark of his. We were
really quite friendly, by that time, playing together like
two children, not much older than Peterkins, and the
rather ironic attitude toward me which I had so resented,
seemed to lessen, or at least to be less noticeable.</p>

<p>If it hadn't been for Peter&mdash;or, if it hadn't been for
me&mdash;and if Bill hadn't said&mdash;</p>

<p>Anyway, our even, sunny life and relationship came to
an abrupt end.</p>

<p>On a day when Bill elected to golf with Mr. Howells&mdash;Mercedes
had developed wonderfully as a gallery of one!&mdash;I
chose to stay at home and attend to a number of
small neglected duties. The day before we had spent
near Mariano, with one of the secretaries at the American
Legation and his wife. We had had a delightful day, in
a most fascinating house, all cool, wide patios, and flat
roofs, over which the palms waved. It seemed to me as
if I were not in Cuba or even Spain, but somewhere in the
Far East. At tea-time, the wife of the Chinese Minister
called, a tiny lady, exquisite and low-voiced, looking far
too young to be the mother of seven sturdy children, as
she proudly assured me she was. To hear her talk of
"my boy in Yale" seemed positively absurd. It was, as
I have said, a delightful day, but tiring, and I was content
to stay at home when the next day dawned, very hot
and still.</p>

<p>Peter rode in the morning and chased, hatless, about
the grounds in the afternoon. He had made many
friends among the <i>muchachos</i>. I saw him at luncheon
and then, not until after tea. Something, perhaps the
very oppressive atmosphere, made me restless and out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
sorts. I started about half-past four, to walk aimlessly
toward the gates and encountering Peter and Wiggles invited
them to accompany me. Afterwards, it occurred to
me that Peter seemed very quiet. He walked along beside
me, his hands in the pockets of his sailor-suit, with
none of his usual flow of general misinformation. But I
was preoccupied more so than I had been in weeks. Father
had been in my thoughts all day, and back in my
brain there were other thoughts&mdash;vague and unformed,
but curiously disturbing. I was beset with a desire, a
longing for something&mdash;I knew not what. It was, perhaps,
a species of Spring-fever, of wanderlust, which
seized upon me and set me to walking now over-fast, now
languidly.</p>

<p>We had gone perhaps a half a mile when a strange
little sound escaped from Peter's lips. For the first time
I looked at his little mouth, a white line stood out against
the dark red color.</p>

<p>"It's the heat," I said to myself, and asked him anxiously,</p>

<p>"Do you feel very warm, Peterkins?"</p>

<p>His answer was almost inaudible, and he drooped
wearily against my side, as we stood there in the white
road, with the distant fringe of mountains almost dancing
under quivering waves of heat.</p>

<p>Wiggles, panting, looked at us anxiously, his scrap of
a tongue between his crooked teeth.</p>

<p>"We'll go right home," said I, feigning an unconcern
I did not feel.</p>

<p>I took his hand and was terrified at the burning touch
of it, realizing that the child was ill, perhaps seriously so,
and that we were half a mile from home.</p>

<p>Something like despair came over me. It was out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
the question that I could carry Peter&mdash;he was a tall boy
for his age and very heavy. It only remained to put my
arm about him and to coax him along, a slow and painful
task.</p>

<p>We had covered the first half of the distance when I
heard a car behind us, and turned hopefully to hail it.
And when the long green body shot clearly into sight, I
was suddenly faint with relief. Bill, coming back early
from the club! Bill, at the wheel, his hat off, and the
wind blowing his dark hair.</p>

<p>The car stopped.</p>

<p>"Mavis! It's too hot for you and Peter to be out.
I didn't play&mdash;what's the matter?"</p>

<p>I lifted Peter in my arms.</p>

<p>"It's Peter, Bill," I said. "He's&mdash;ill."</p>

<p>In two minutes I was in the back seat with the half-delirious
boy in my arms, and Bill was urging the car
to her utmost speed, and we were suddenly home.</p>

<p>Between them, Bill and Sarah got Peter into bed. I
was too frightened to be of any use. I kept thinking of
the little Reynolds boy who had died of fever in that very
house ... and of Peter's mother. But I didn't dare
think of her long, because I could see her eyes so plainly
as they looked when she said,</p>

<p>"You'll take good care of Peter for me, won't you,
Mavis?"</p>

<p>Good care of Peter! For a week I had hardly thought
of him. I kissed him mornings and nights, gave him his
lessons, listened to his chatter, not really heeding. And
I had been away so much, drunken with my new freedom,
my strength, blooming like a plant in the climate that
tried so many other people sorely: utterly wrapped up in
my own sensations and impressions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>I went softly into the room Peter shared with Sarah.
It was a different boy tossing on the bed, with that curious
flush, the groping hands, talking incessantly, incoherently.</p>

<p>Bill, bending over him, looked up as I came in. His
face was strange to me too. No, not quite. I had seen
that intense, almost grim, look on that face once before&mdash;as
I came out of a dark hour of agony and looked, for the
first time, into two steel-blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it?" I asked very low. "Is he dangerously ill?"</p>

<p>"A touch of sun," he answered. "Yes, he's pretty
sick."</p>

<p>There was nothing I could do. All that night I went
in and out of the room, glad if they would let me bring
them little things: water, a glass, a spoon.</p>

<p>It made matters worse to find Nora praying loudly in
the kitchen, and Silas, his lean face all broken up into soft
lines of anxiety and sorrow, watching up with her.</p>

<p>The news spread, in some indeterminable fashion.
During the night, a number of the men on the plantation
came to the door to ask for news. Peter had endeared
himself to half Guayabal&mdash;</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the morning, worn out, I went
into the bathroom for something for Bill. As I did not
reappear with it he came to look for me presently, and
found me, huddled against the wall, my hands at my
throat, an abject picture of cowardice and fright.</p>

<p>I was not alone in the room. A few yards away from
me, on the tiled floor, a spider was sprawling, regarding
me with almost human, terribly malicious eyes. The creature
was as large as a tea-cup, black, horribly spotted with
red, it's many legs twitching with vicious life.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?" Bill asked as I pointed with a shaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
hand to the spider, which at the sound of another step
had taken itself quickly to another corner of the room.</p>

<p>My husband put his arm about me, and conducted me
safely to my own room,</p>

<p>"You poor child!" was all he said, and closed the door
into the bathroom. A few minutes later I heard him
occupied in there, with what seemed, or sounded, like a
golf-club. There was a scuffle. Once I heard Bill curse,
and then finally silence.</p>

<p>Presently, my door opened and Bill came in.</p>

<p>"I've disposed of your visitor," he said, quite cheerfully.
"Nasty mess. And Peter is better. He'll be all
right, I'm sure, only we shall have to be very careful of
him after this. And now, I want you to go to bed or I
shall have another patient on my hands."</p>

<p>I went to bed; but not until the rain came, about five,
and Peter's room became quiet, did I fall into a troubled
sleep.</p>

<p>It was past noon before I woke. Sarah looking very
tired came in with some coffee and the assurance that
Peter was out of all danger and was sleeping quietly with
the fever broken.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sarah," I said, "you haven't had any sleep."</p>

<p>"Dr. Denton sent me to bed at five," she answered,
"but he never took his own clothes off until about eight.
I slept in the guest room, the other side of Peter's, and
when I woke, about seven, again, I got some coffee for
him from Norah. And he left me with Peter then, and
went into his own room."</p>

<p>"Is he asleep now?" I asked getting out of bed.</p>

<p>"No, for I heard the water running in his bath, half
an hour ago."</p>

<p>While I was dressing I heard Bill in Peter's room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Heard too, with what gratitude, Peter's own normal voice,
weak but sane again.</p>

<p>I slipped on a frock hastily and went in to them. Of
the two, I thought that Bill looked the worst, very white
and drawn.</p>

<p>After luncheon when Wing had disappeared in the
pantry, Bill told me that Peter had had a very close
call.</p>

<p>"I don't like to blame anyone, of course," he said, with
knitted brows, "but if Sarah didn't have sense enough&mdash;well,
Silas has lived in Cuba long enough to have known
that the heat yesterday was sufficient to knock out a
strong man, much less a little boy, if he became over-tired."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it was my fault," I answered, slowly,
"Peter was riding all morning and romping all afternoon.
And then I took him for a walk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you know then that he had been playing hard all
day?" Bill asked me.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I said honestly, "but I was thinking about
something else, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bill's hand went out in an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>"Didn't <i>you</i> feel the heat?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," I answered, "but I had been in the
house all day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Peter hadn't!" he finished for me, somewhat irrelevantly,
I thought.</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>"It's incredible," said my husband, with extreme irritation,
"that you shouldn't have noticed."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" I began, and stopped. It was true. I hadn't
noticed; and it was equally true that the fact was incredible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>Conscious of my guilt, I was still able to be resentful of
my husband's tone.</p>

<p>"Do you think for a minute&mdash;" I began indignantly,
with no clear idea of how I was going to finish: so perhaps
it was just as well that I was interrupted.</p>

<p>"I don't think anything at all," he said, "but I <i>know</i>
that I shouldn't have gone away. Had I known the day
was going to turn out such a scorcher, I would have
stayed."</p>

<p>His tone implied that what he should have known was
that I was not fit to be trusted alone. I didn't like the
implication, and I said so.</p>

<p>After which, at the end of ten minutes, I had positively
flounced from the room, after the manner of our grandmothers,
and left him sitting there.</p>

<p>I didn't see him again until dinner. It was not a particularly
joyful meal.</p>

<p>During the rather silent progress of dinner, I had the
grace to be rather ashamed of some of the things I had
said. In the cooler light of reason, I looked on a number
of the statements I had made and found them unconvincing.</p>

<p>Our sporadic conversation was of trivial things. Not
until Wing had departed kitchenward, and Bill lighted his
after-luncheon cigarette, was our late unpleasantness alluded
to.</p>

<p>"Mavis," said my husband, with a hint of the old,
ironic smile I had not seen in many weeks, and which
immediately alienated me from him, "I'm afraid that we
were both a little tired and over-wrought this morning.
And for anything I said which may have offended you,
I am quite ready to ask your pardon. However, it is,
perhaps, just as well that I understand the way you feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
about me. I am, admittedly then, a 'brute': and I have
'presumed' to criticize you, unfairly and without cause&mdash;or
so you have said. Let that pass. The most important
thing is that you are becoming bored with this
solitary confinement, and it so happens that it is within
my power to offer you more congenial companionship. I
had a letter this morning from Wright Penny&mdash;you recall
him, do you not? He is in Santiago, and proposes
to come to Havana and run out to see us. If it is agreeable
to you, I shall wire him to come on prepared to stay,
and to return North with us when we go. Would you
like that?"</p>

<p>Seven times seven little devils entered into me then,
and I clasped my hands on the table and made my eyes
round with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I would be delighted," I said, sincerely enough. "I
liked Mr. Penny&mdash;what little I saw of him. And I am
sure that he would be a congenial house-guest."</p>

<p>"Our first," remarked Bill, with a wholly wicked grin.
And I felt as if we had slipped back several months, to a
time when enmity was the only possible thing between us,
and our weeks of pleasant comradeship were the shadow
of a dream.</p>

<p>There must be, I thought, a very real antagonism for
one another in our natures: for otherwise, so deep and
unspoken a breach could not have been made in ten minutes
of foolish anger.</p>

<p>"Wright says," Bill continued, "that he hesitates to
intrude upon our 'happy honeymoon hours.' A pretty
alliteration. It is not necessary, I hope, to inform him of
his mistake."</p>

<p>"He may have eyes&mdash;" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Being a poet," he objected, "he is probably myopic."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>I ignored this.</p>

<p>"I must find him some pretty girls to play with," I said
idly.</p>

<p>"Mercedes," said Bill, "might fit the case."</p>

<p>I was conscious of a sudden flare of anger.</p>

<p>"Bobby Willard's little sister," I said, "seems more
Mr. Penny's type. She is very gentle and lovely."</p>

<p>"Meow?" said my husband, with a rising inflection.</p>

<p>The bright color came to my cheeks.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said indignantly. "I like Mercedes
Howell very much. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bill raised an eyebrow, smiled at the glowing end of
the cigarette in his hand and said nothing.</p>

<p>He got up from the table and went toward the door.</p>

<p>"Have Miss Willard out here by all means," he said,
"but she's milk and water. For my own amusement, in
my own humble opinion, Mercedes is more stimulating to
the Tired Business Man."</p>

<p>He stopped to light another cigarette.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, through the first breath of smoke,
"Wright will naturally suspect you of match-making.
All young, happily married women have that benign tendency."</p>

<p>I was stricken dumb with sudden hatred, and before
my lips could open again, Bill, with Wiggles at his heels,
went out into the sunshine, whistling the challenging song
from the first act of "Carmen."</p>

<p>I went to my room and wrote a letter, which, however,
I was destined never to send, to Richard Warren.</p>

<p>Peter's convalescence kept me occupied for several days.
He had a number of sympathetic callers, from Annunciata
to the Howells. I told Mercedes that I would expect her
out often to amuse our impending poet, and she preened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
her bright plumage a little and vowed that a new man
would be a "God-send," looking at Bill the while. At
which, with that long-drawn "Me-ow!" still ringing in
my ears, I asked her and her parents to join us at dinner
the night following Mr. Penny's expected arrival.</p>

<p>On the morning of that arrival Bill tossed over to me
a letter from Uncle John Denton.</p>

<p>"There are messages in it for you," he said, and opened
his long-stale New York <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>I read the letter, and, as I returned it to the envelope,
saw a second sheet which I had not noticed. Uncle John
often sent me little enclosures in Bill's letters. Innocently
I drew it out, unfolded it, and started to read.</p>

<p>"Damn!" said my husband without apology, reaching
my side in two long steps, "I thought I had taken that out.
Give it to me, Mavis!"</p>

<p>But I had already read enough.</p>

<p>"Have you unmasked 'Richard Warren' for Mavis
yet?" wrote Uncle John, "and how does she like being
the wife of her favorite poet? When are we to have the
manuscript of the new volume? You're long overdue
now, you miserable creature!"</p>

<p>"Give it to me!" said Bill.</p>

<p>I handed the note to him without a word. I couldn't
have spoken, had my life depended on it.</p>

<p>He followed me to the door of my room.</p>

<p>"Mavis!" he said once or twice.</p>

<p>I put my hand on the latch.</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me!" I said.</p>

<p>In my room, I sat down by the window and tried to
think what it all meant. For a time, I was incapable of
directed thought. My dream came to me, the dream I
had had so long ago, that nightmare in which my unknown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
poet had changed to the semblance of the man I
had met and disliked on meeting, William Denton. So it
was true then! After a little, I thought of my letters, my
silly, fragile girl-dreams, written for the One, mercilessly
exposed to the eyes of the Other. In my desk drawer lay
yet another letter, unmailed, thank God! A letter in
which I had said I wanted him back, wanted the comfort
and the understanding his letters had brought me once
again. Fool&mdash;fool and blind! And all the time, this
talented trickster had known and laughed: had written
me the friendly, lovely letters with his tongue in his cheek:
had even spoken to me of love!</p>

<p>I went over to the drawer and took out my Diary. All
lies! Some day I must burn it. But not yet. It was like
a living thing to me. The little blue book fell open and
certain words leaped out at me: "Diary, I have found
him.... I've the heart and brain and beautiful spirit of
him, and all day long his name makes a happy spot in
my consciousness. Richard Warren! Richard Warren!..."</p>

<p>I closed the book and laid it back with the letters. A
great sheaf of thin, typewritten pages ... all lies....</p>

<p>Uncle John had been in the plot then: and Wright
Penny. It was very clear to me now.</p>

<p>I took from my neck the jade lucky-charm which
"Richard Warren" had sent me and flung it out of the
window. Wiggles, prowling beneath, barked happily and
set out to retrieve it. Even Wiggles was not mine!
Nothing I had had was mine!</p>

<p>I laid my head on the desk and cried bitterly. It's hard
to see the dreams go: to watch the castle you have builded
on the shifting sands crumble and fall. These things had
meant so much to me, ill and prisoned, and had continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
to make a little, inner life for me, after the physical prison
doors had opened.</p>

<p>If only by a miracle I could have been back in Green
Hill, in my rose-grey room, never to walk again, and
with Richard Warren's letters coming to me, out of the
Unknown.</p>

<p>Then I remembered ... there was no Richard Warren.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XIII</p>

<p class="p2">After a long time, I heard a knock at my door.</p>

<p>"May I speak with you, Mavis, just for a moment?"
said my husband.</p>

<p>I steadied my voice with an effort.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine that you have anything of interest to
tell me," I answered, "Isn't it time you went to Havana
to meet Mr. Penny?"</p>

<p>There was an exclamation, and suddenly the door was
flung open and Bill came in.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "we've got to have this thing
out once and for all."</p>

<p>I was standing, my wet handkerchief in a tight, hard
wad in my hand.</p>

<p>"Please leave my room," I said coldly.</p>

<p>"Not till I've said what I want to. I'm sorry you
found out&mdash;about the book. I was going to tell you&mdash;later.
But now that you have, we can't ignore it. It was
the merest coincidence that I met you before your first
letter came. And I was deep in it, before I realized that
you were bound to dislike me, as I really am,&mdash;and then
I couldn't tell you. Things you said in your letters made
it absolutely impossible for me. And for reasons of my
own, I had preserved my incognito very carefully. Only
Uncle John knew, and Wright and my Mother&mdash;and&mdash;your
Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>Father! And his mother! The little "red-haired,
blue-eyed" lady who had written to me: to whom I had
confided my admiration for her son!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>Minute by minute, shame was flooding me: shame and
a terribly tired feeling.</p>

<p>"Does your mother know&mdash;?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That we are married? No," he answered, "I had
reasons for not telling her just yet. She knows I am in
Cuba, of course. You have never asked me about my
people so I hardly thought it worth while to mention
her to you&mdash;under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry it has turned out as it has," he said, after
a pause. "You don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>I could agree with him there.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," I said.</p>

<p>He lifted his shoulders ever so slightly, a gesture of
defeat.</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;" he said, but something in my eyes stopped
him. His face grew very hard.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "that you are making a mountain
out of a molehill. A range of mountains. Because I
wrote a few verses that struck your fancy: because you
did not like the actual, flesh-and-blood author: because
I preferred to hide behind my nom-de-plume, and because
you choose to honor Richard Warren with your friendly
regard&mdash;" he shrugged again, "and because, perhaps
foolishly, I want to be liked for what I am, and not for
what I set down on paper&mdash;I preferred to play what I
fancied was a very charming little game&mdash;and now you
accuse me of having cheated."</p>

<p>"I have nothing of the sort," I answered. "But did
it not occur to you, during your 'little game' that you
were playing with an opponent wholly innocent of the
fact that she was playing blindfolded, and that the cards
were&mdash;stacked?"</p>

<p>We both heard the car drive up to the front door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," he said, "my cards are on the table now,
Mavis."</p>

<p>"The car is waiting," I said. "You had best go. As
far as I am concerned, the game is over. Richard Warren,
as I knew him, never existed,&mdash;only a very clever
young doctor who amused himself at my expense.
Here," I said, turning to the open drawer, "are your
letters. Take them, please. They would make good
reading of the type which is called 'light fiction.'"</p>

<p>"Careful," said Bill, under his breath, and his hand
shot out and caught my arm, "careful, Mavis! You are
going just a little too far."</p>

<p>I twisted my arm away.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;?" I asked furiously, "and&mdash;<i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, and the clear flame of
anger leaped into the steel-blue eyes.</p>

<p>The door closed behind him. I stood for a moment,
quite still, rubbing the bruised place on my arm which
his fingers had made.</p>

<p>Richard Warren's letters lay on the floor. I caught
them up, hurried to the living room. There was a burning
log on the hearth, and under Bill's hostile eyes, as
he gathered up his hat and gloves, I put the sheets in
the fire.</p>

<p>They writhed, shot high in flame, and blackening, fell
to ashes. Something in me cried out at that&mdash;they had
been so dear, so dear.</p>

<p>"Have you my letters?" I asked him, rising and dusting
off my hands.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "I never keep letters."</p>

<p>It was the one redeeming fact that had come to my
knowledge that day. I mentioned this, and went past
him, into my own room again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to me that, in an hour's space, I had lived
many years and grown very old.</p>

<p>When I heard the car drive off, I went out on the
verandah with Peter and played with him for a time
before I dressed. I wanted to look my prettiest for
Mr. Penny. And I blessed a kindly Providence that
he was to interrupt my wholly impossible <i>m&eacute;nage</i>-&agrave;-<i>deux</i>.
And one determination I made: as soon as I returned
to Green Hill, I would take steps to be free again.
Father would soon get used to the idea: it would hurt
him, of course, but someone is always being hurt. Travel&mdash;perhaps
Father would take me to the Continent. But
never again to the tropics. I had had enough of their
soft, friendly ways and their treachery. When it was
necessary that Uncle John Denton be told of the predestined
fiasco of my marriage, I for one, would not
shirk it. Bill was his nephew, but I was the daughter
of his dearest friend, and he had cared for me since I
was a baby. Sometimes, quite recently, I had fancied
that he had cared, too, for my mother. But at all events,
he would not be angry with me when he knew. Of that
much I was certain.</p>

<p>It was a very cordial and sparkling hostess who met
her guest and her husband at the door. I had put on the
little white voile which, of all my daytime frocks, I
thought the most becoming. I had dressed my hair high
and thrust a wonderful orchid through my mauve belt.
My cheeks were burning and I had a moment of stage-fright
as I heard the wheels of the car on the drive. It
would not be easy to carry it off, to hide my hurt and my
shame&mdash;but pride helps wonderfully, always, in any
situation, and I was quite satisfied with the girl who
looked back at me from the long mirror in the living-room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
as I passed it on my way to the verandah. But
although all the stains of crying had gone from my
eyes and left them bright, they were different eyes than
the ones which had read the first lines of Uncle John's
letter. Brown eyes, and big&mdash;but with all the dreams
washed from them. Perhaps it was better so.</p>

<p>"A very hearty welcome, Mr. Penny," I said, smiling,
as our slight, blonde guest untangled himself from his
bags and jumped to the step, "it's good to see you again."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Mrs. Denton," he expostulated,
not heeding my greeting, but taking both my hands in
his, "don't ruin my first impression of this ripping place
and of this miraculous You by pinning that awful label
on me. Do you think," he begged, "that you could
manage 'Wright'?"</p>

<p>"In fair exchange for 'Mavis,'" I answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"You're on!" he said, dropping my hands after a
vigorous clasp, "that is to say, if Bill has no objection."</p>

<p>Bill turned from a colloquy with Wing and Silas and
waved benevolently in our direction.</p>

<p>"Not an objection," he answered gaily. "Mavis has
me trained. Her word is, naturally, my law."</p>

<p>If that was the tone he wished to adopt, I was convinced
that here, at least, was a game which two could
play.</p>

<p>"Bill is a very satisfactory husband," I confided to
Wright, pleasantly. "He and I have discovered the
best basis possible for matrimony."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Wright, as we went into the
living-room. "Lord, you lucky people, what a wonderful
house!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" I said, and then, answering the question,
"A mutual platform of Liberty, Independence and&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>"Love!" said Wright, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"How did you guess it?" asked Bill, following his
guest.</p>

<p>I laughed, a little hysterically, and bade Bill show
Wright to his room. After which, with a sense of having
scored, I waited for the men near the dining-table, luncheon
having been announced.</p>

<p>"We're late today," I said, as we all sat down. "I
postponed the sacred meal a little to allow you to arrive."</p>

<p>"It's only one-thirty," objected Wright, looking at his
watch.</p>

<p>"I know, but one does things differently in Guayabal,"
I said, explaining our usual routine.</p>

<p>"Some life!" said the newly initiated. "Suits me.
Let's stay on here forever. I imagine," he went on,
turning to include us both in his remark, "that nothing
could have been more perfect for the <i>lune de miel</i>."</p>

<p>Bill was silent, but I agreed hastily.</p>

<p>"And now tell us about Santiago," I said.</p>

<p>The recital occupied most of the conversational part
of the meal pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>"See my pretty senoritas?" asked Bill, passing the
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Cuban?" inquired Wright, taking one. "That's
good&mdash;I've developed a passion for them. No, not a
senorita. All I saw were at least ninety and weighed a
ton."</p>

<p>"I've got just the girl for you!" said Bill and I, simultaneously.</p>

<p>Wright laughed.</p>

<p>"The same one?" he asked, with interest.</p>

<p>"No, our tastes differ," I answered, "the one I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
in mind is little and round and brown-haired. She's delightful."</p>

<p>"And mine," said Bill, "is just the right height, just
the right shape, and as dark-haired and creamy-skinned
as a Spanish princess. She is half Spanish, too, which
means&mdash;temperament."</p>

<p>"Very interesting," said Wright. "Bring 'em both
on. But I like amber-colored hair and brown eyes myself.
Did you corner the market on the combination,
Bill?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered Bill gravely, "there aren't two
like Mavis. That mould was broken."</p>

<p>"Lucky for me," agreed Wright, sighing. "I want
to stay a carefree bachelor. I'm susceptible enough,
Lord knows,&mdash;and very guileless. But my appearance
protects me, as well as a certain modesty, not to say
timidity, of manner. I've not your looks, nor your way
with the wimmin, you handsome bridegroom," he concluded
affectionately, smiling at Bill.</p>

<p>"Do tell me," I asked, leaning back in my great, carved
chair, quite conscious that it served as an effective background
for my hair, "about Bill's past. I can't get a
word out of him on the subject."</p>

<p>There was a spark of admiration in the glance Bill
shot me&mdash;an involuntary tribute.</p>

<p>"Wait till we're alone," whispered Wright, mysteriously.
"I could a tale unfold&mdash;! Enough to turn
your hair grey. Broken hearts all over the place&mdash;he
just stepped on 'em. Anonymous letters, begging for
a lock of hair or an old glove! There have been times
when your husband, Madame, has been forced to assume
a disguise!"</p>

<p>"You colossal idiot," said Bill amiably.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't listen to him, Mavis," urged Bill's best friend.
"Listen to me instead!"</p>

<p>"I'm willing to be convinced," I answered. "And now
that you're both on your second cigarette, shall we walk
about the place a little? Bill," I went on, turning to him,
very sweetly, "would you mind running to my room
and getting my big, lavender shade hat&mdash;? It's right on
the bureau."</p>

<p>For a moment I thought that he would shake me. I
knew he wanted to. But, instead, he swung obediently
away and took his revenge in a careless "All right, dear!"
as he went off.</p>

<p>"Isn't he a peach!" mused Wright aloud, watching
admiringly the broad-shouldered figure across the
room.</p>

<p>"You've known him long?" I asked, in order to avoid
answering.</p>

<p>"Roommates at Princeton," he replied. "Those were
the good old days! There never was a more popular
man in college than old Bill! I basked in reflected glory
all the time. He was always the King Pin among us,
whether it was football, or writing skits, or drumming the
piano."</p>

<p>"You must have a lot in common," I suggested, "especially
your poetry&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wright's round, blue eyes grew rounder than ever.</p>

<p>"He's told you!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said, smiling to cover the pain in my
heart, "did you think he could keep it from me? Besides,
I half-guessed it all the time."</p>

<p>"I told Bill that," said my guest, triumphantly, and
then, as Bill emerged from my room, gingerly carrying
the hat, as if it were a species of lavender lydite, "Well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Richard Warren, I suppose by now your wife is your
severest critic!"</p>

<p>The hat fluttered from Bill's grasp. I shrieked. But
he caught it again deftly.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said, handing it to me, and went
on, "My kindest critic, you mean, but&mdash;my critic always."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the new book?" asked Wright
of me, as stopping only to collect Peterkins, we went from
the house, down the long avenue of palms. "I've only
seen a bit, but I tell him it's better than the first&mdash;surer,
more mature, bigger in every way."</p>

<p>"She hasn't seen it," answered Bill, hastily. "I don't
want her to for a while yet."</p>

<p>"Oh," Wright nodded understandingly, "I see."</p>

<p>Just what he saw was beyond me, but I said, with a
little sigh,</p>

<p>"I'm so impatient&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You couldn't be that," said my husband, "not even
when it comes to my new book."</p>

<p>"Very pretty," observed Wright, regarding us both,
impartially.</p>

<p>"Isn't she?"</p>

<p>This was too much. I turned the conversation in the
direction of our coming dinner party and to a discussion
of hibiscus-bloom. But all through that afternoon
through the banter, the sparkling surface talk, of dinner
that night, through the hours before I fell asleep, I was
trying to adjust myself to the fact that it was, after all,
Bill who had written <i>The Lyric Hour</i>; who had so
beautifully said so many true and lovely things: who was
a very high-hearted poet.</p>

<p>No matter how little of his real self he had shown me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
in his letters, regardless of the obvious misfit of his poems
and his living personality, he had written those poems:
they were his. And they must have sprung from some
eternal and true fount of beauty in his nature, or else
all books lied and all the poets who ever lived to gladden
the world with their songs were tricksters and jesters,
with a command of rythmical English and no more. I
could not believe that. And so, I must believe that my
husband had written truly and sung faithfully, from his
heart. And that is what I could not understand, could
not reconcile with him, himself. He had hurt me, had
wounded my pride beyond endurance: I hated him, I
wished myself free of his mere presence: but I was, in
the last analysis, forced to admit his genius, and forced
to acknowledge his power. Richard Warren had never
existed, not the Richard Warren I had built up from a
slender volume of verse and a drawer-full of letters.
But William Denton did exist, very solidly, and for me,
distastefully. And William Denton had written <i>The
Lyric Hour</i>.</p>

<p>It may not be difficult, given certain conditions, to hate
a poet, but it seemed too bad.</p>

<p class="p2">The following night our very informal dinner took
place. We had asked some other people, to make up a
party of ten, and so we had quite a formidable array of
"valor and beauty" around the long, refectory table.
Mr. and Mrs. Howells and their daughter, the Chinese
Minister and his wife, Bobby Willard and his sister Ruth,
Wright, Bill and myself, all rather diplomatically placed,
made up the group. It was a rather amusing, and incidentally,
an excellent meal. Over the massed orchids on
the table, I could see Wright almost feverishly attentive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
alternately, to Ruth Willard in pale-blue on his left, and
to Mercedes, in an amazing frock of black lace, a cluster
of orange flowers at her girdle, seated between him and
my husband. At my end of the table I had Mr. Howells
and the courteous gentleman from the Orient. And Mrs.
Howells, at Bill's right, watched indolently her daughter's
radiant progress and applied herself, mutely, to the
business of eating. In consequence, Mercedes, during the
greater part of the meal, drove tandem; and it was really
pretty to watch&mdash;only, by the salad course, it had grown
monotonous.</p>

<p>After dinner we had two tables of bridge. Fortunately,
I played rather a good game, Father having taught me
patiently, in order to provide one more time-killer, during
my shut-inism. As we were ten, two were left to
play the piano, to sit out on the verandah, to stroll about
the grounds. I had cleverly manoeuvered that Wright
and Ruth be left, but something went wrong, and Bill,
announcing that he did not care to play, was joined by
Mercedes, who insisted that the only rule she knew was
"not to trump her partner's ace." I fancied, however,
that she was well equipped with the finesse instinct.</p>

<p>"And even that I often forget," she said, laughing.
"Me, I have so little use for rules!"</p>

<p>So it eventually and naturally came about that Bill and
Mercedes stayed out of the game, joined now and then
by whoever was dummy.</p>

<p>For a while they remained at the far end of the room,
at the piano&mdash;Bill, black and white in his dinner clothes,
dreaming over the keys, Mercedes, leaning on the piano,
her huge orange feather fan at her lips, singing snatches
of Spanish songs from behind its shelter, her dark eyes
glowing. It was, I was forced to admit to Mrs. Howells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
playing at my table, a pretty picture, softened and romantic
in the flicker of fire light which shone over the two and
danced on the mahogany case of the Steinway.</p>

<p>Later, they went out: Wright followed them presently,
in his momentary freedom as dummy, for "a breath of
air and a cigarette."</p>

<p>I made a Grand Slam.</p>

<p>Wright, returning, to take his place, paused to regard
the score over my shoulder, and to whisper,</p>

<p>"Is that the girl Bill picked out for me? What does
he take me for, a lion-tamer?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" I said, conscious of Mrs. Howells' proximity.
But she was criticizing her husband's last play and did
not hear us.</p>

<p>It was twelve o'clock before our guests left. Mercedes,
in a gorgeous black and orange cloak, seemed reluctant
to depart.</p>

<p>"I've had <i>such</i> a wonderful evening!" she told me,
"and Billy was <i>so</i> entertaining!"</p>

<p>I had always disliked the schoolgirl manner of talking
in exclamations and italics.</p>

<p>Wright, bidding me good-night, remarked, with mock
gravity,</p>

<p>"I'm going to buy a whip and a gun tomorrow, Mavis!
That Howells girl needs a dressing down."</p>

<p>"Dressing down?" I asked, not a little maliciously,
recalling with inner amusement, Mercedes' somewhat revealing
gown.</p>

<p>But if Wright did not understand me, as I hoped he
would not, my husband did, and his inevitable "Meow!"
followed me into my room and lingered there for some
time.</p>

<p>War to the knife&mdash;!

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p2 left65">
<span class="smcap">Guayabal, Cuba</span>&mdash;<br />
and Heaven knows what date.</p>

<p>Father, dearest&mdash;</p>

<p>We have enjoyed your letters so much, and I am glad that
you have Uncle John to bear you out in your statements
that you are almost well and strong again, otherwise it would
seem too good to be true. What a fright you gave us all,
you dear Daddy.</p>

<p>It is perfect here: if only you were with us I would be
the happiest girl in the world. Peter is all better again. I
hope I shall never live through another night like the one
when we nearly lost him. Bill is wonderful with children&mdash;I
never saw such patience and tenderness and sanity.</p>

<p>We see quite a lot of Mercedes. I am sure she would
enchant you, she is so pretty. But I should be jealous, you
know, if she ever adopted you as a second father, as she
threatened to do when I showed her your picture. Your
picture, by the way, is the next thing to the flesh and blood
you! I talk to it by the hour.</p>

<p>Bill has confessed the Richard Warren hoax! Quite involuntarily.
I must admit surprise, but of course I am
terrifically proud of him. And you knew all along, you
wretch, and never told me!</p>

<p>It was amusing of you to scold me for not going to the
races. But crowds&mdash;the bare idea of them confused me so.
However, Bill insisted upon reading that part of your letter
and carried me off, on your authority, if you please, to sit
for hours in a funny little box and watch the people and the
horses and smell the track and disgrace myself by rising
suddenly and shouting as my horse came in!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
I won twelve dollars and am very haughty about it!</p>

<p>I think if I had ever seen a horse-race while I was ill,
could such a thing have happened, I would have died. Such
sheer, wonderful poetry of motion! Bill laughed at me and
promises me more thrills when the racing season is on in
New York. He says the Cuban race horses are a "lot of
junk"&mdash;but he doesn't realize what it meant to me. No one
can realize what it means to me, to be unfettered, to walk,
to feel well, to be hostess in my own (borrowed) home, <i>to
be like other girls</i>! It is no longer a miracle, of course.
Nothing is, for very long, except perhaps&mdash;life. And I
look back on all my invalid years with amazement: it seems
a dream, a fantasy, remote and impossible. It is as though I
had always lived&mdash;as now,&mdash;really <i>lived</i>, Daddy dearest!</p>

<p>My letters are terribly long! And I write you much
oftener than you me. We all send our love. Peter and I
go further&mdash;we send kisses.</p>

<p>Stay safe. Stay well, and write to your happy</p>

<p><span class="smcap left50">Mavis</span>.</p></div>

<p>We have no calendar here, my small, enchanting daughter,
and so there are no such things as dates, only nights and
days and splendid undivided hours.</p>

<p>I was happy to have your letter. And you must not worry
about me&mdash;I feel twenty years younger and, so John says,
look it. You will not know your old Dad when you see him.</p>

<p>I miss you, my dear. This is our first separation. I could
not stand another. I hope that you have persuaded Bill
that my home must still be your home, when we are all together
again. At first it seemed unwise, two young things
starting out in life, saddled with the presence of a third person.
For I am a third person now&mdash;it is right that I should
be. But I am very selfish. I want to enjoy my girl, this
new, wonderful manifestation of her. And there is room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
in the old house for us all: you may tinker with it as you
please, add where you will, and I will keep from under your
feet. I am certain that Bill will have all the practice he
needs to keep him from getting rusty&mdash;even in Green Hill.
And good old Mac is quite ready to abdicate in his favor.
How splendidly it has all worked out! Never a day passes
that I do not thank God for your health, for your happiness,
and for my own reprieve.</p>

<p>Give my love to my son-in-law. I will answer his
letter shortly. Tell Peter I've a present for him&mdash;we've a
guide up here who is a genius with a pen-knife and a scrap
of wood.</p>

<p>And inform Sarah that the last snap-shot of her you sent
me is a marvel! She's entirely too rejuvenated for Green
Hill.</p>

<p>To you, my child, the tenderest affection of your devoted</p>

<span class="smcap">Father</span>.</p></div>

<p>I think, perhaps, that the hardest task I had, during
the lazy days in Cuba, was writing to Father. There
were times when the irony of the situation moved me
to something very like laughter. A bitter form of mirth,
and one I never thought to know. As carefully as any
novelist, I built up my little fictionary happiness, evolved
my plot, drew my characters, retaining enough of truth,
and committing seven times seven sins of omission. It
seemed to me, at times, that it was not I who wrote, but
another Mavis, a happy Mavis, living in a tropical dream,
companioned and at peace,&mdash;the Mavis I might have
been&mdash;if&mdash;</p>

<p>What tears my guardian angel must have shed! What
blotted pages must have soiled the ledger!</p>

<p>I wondered very often, if lies we tell to spare others
are counted lies in the heavenly books. After all, surely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
we are not judged by earthly standards, there must be a
larger vision and a more tolerant viewpoint. And sometimes,
where the truth ended and where falsehood began,
seemed hidden from me: times when the dream
seemed real and reality a dream&mdash;

<p class="p2">I had gone, with my writing things, to heap pillows
on the lawn beneath that curious tropical "Sabre" tree,
which is entirely covered with thick, wicked spikes, magnified
and dangerous thorns. This tree wears smooth
with age, they say&mdash;like a number of human beings,
perhaps!&mdash;and the natives hold it in superstitious awe,

<p>Lying prone, elbows propped on my gay cushion, my
chin in my hands, I contemplated the last verse I had
made, considered a title, decided on "Ultimus," and then,
weighting the sheet with a round, yellow orange, I rolled
over on my back, and crossing my arms beneath my head
looked up at the sky.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful morning, cloudless, perfect, not too
oppressively warm. And it was the first breathing spell
I had had in several days. The business of having as
a house guest an eligible young bachelor, of charm and
astonishing vitality, was a little wearing. And I was
glad when the day came on which Wright concluded
that an hour or so in the saddle, with Bill as escort
would be both beneficial to his constitution and instructive
mentally.</p>

<p>Quite aside from the arduous task of exhibiting Havana
and environs to a tireless young man, the effort of
"keeping up appearances" had really begun to tell on
me. Wright was particularly keen-sighted, and I more
than once fancied that he had caught a glimpse of the
black waters under the thin verbal ice upon which Bill and
I so carelessly skated.</p>

<p>My husband and I had not been alone together since
the arrival of his friend. I had seen to that. When we
were not in Havana, or at the country club, there were
people at the "Palms." And to insure perfect satisfaction
for everyone concerned, I had asked Mercedes Howells
to bring a bag, and spend a few days in the country.
She had accepted with alacrity, and there remained to
me but a few hours of comparative peace before she descended
upon the household.</p>

<p>I looked across at the mountains: purple blue they were,
clear-cut against a marvelous sky. The air was very still.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
I could hear Arthur shrieking from the house. He had
learned a number of fine, full-bodied Cuban-Spanish
oaths lately, and was employing them in his most wheedling
manner on Nora.</p>

<p>The ox-carts went by on the road below. A bird
swayed on the bourganvilla vine and sang. Down in the
palm-grove I saw the flick of a peacock tail, and the orchids,
themselves like lavender birds, in the distance,
flowering from the smooth palm trunks.</p>

<p>My eyes closed and I slept.</p>

<p>When I awoke, someone was sitting cross-legged beside
me, whistling "Sally in our Alley."</p>

<p>I saw puttees and riding breeches, a hand holding a
cigarette, and finally a blonde countenance which was
turned upward to the sky.</p>

<p>"Hello," I said. "How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Hours," he answered. "Mavis Denton, you talk in
your sleep, you do, somethin' awful!"</p>

<p>I sat up abruptly.</p>

<p>"What did I say?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"First you snored some&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't snore!"</p>

<p>"You do,&mdash;Bill told me so. 'Wright,' he says to me,
'don't you never marry a girl who snores.'"</p>

<p>There was no use arguing with Wright in a silly
mood.</p>

<p>"Go on," I said, resigned to heaven alone knew what
eccentricities of speech and disclosure.</p>

<p>"I'm going. First you snores a bit, as I remarked
before I was so rudely interrupted. Who raised you,
anyway, Mavis? Don't you know little girls must never
contradict, interrupt, or otherwise distract old gentlemen?
Well, after the snore&mdash;musical, it was&mdash;'Bill!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
you says, entreating-like&mdash;'Bill,' you says, right out loud.
And then, just like a movie heroine, 'Never!' you shouts,
'Never!', and you clinched your hands and ground your
teeth as no lady had oughter!"</p>

<p>"I never heard of anything so silly," I said, "You're
making it all up!"</p>

<p>Wright laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm not, truly," he said, "although perhaps I have
rendered it in a slightly more lurid manner than you did.
But it's true, and I'm going to ask Bill what it's all about,
so there!"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare!" I said.</p>

<p>"All right, I won't, if you will promise me never to
blush again like you have been doing for the last three
minutes. It is very disturbing, to a struggling poet who
has long sought fresher similes for Dawn and all that
sort of thing. You provided the simile, all right, but
who in time could rhyme with Mavis?"</p>

<p>At the mention of poetry, my hand unconsciously went
toward the sheet of paper beside me. The orange rolled
away and the wind provokingly caught the paper and
fluttered it.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said the audacious youth beside me.
"Ha! I see Bill's fine Italian hand in this&mdash;"</p>

<p>He picked up the paper, regardless of my pleas, and
scanned it with a practised eye.</p>

<p>"Your writing. Amanuensis now, eh? Hm&mdash;that
doesn't sound like Bill. Wait a moment, I never saw such
illegible calligraphy. At least one member of a doctor's
family ought to write so a fellow can read it&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laid the paper down.</p>

<p>"Bill didn't write that," he said, suddenly serious,
"who did? You, Mavis?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Why, you little wretch," he cried out, delightedly.
"Bill never told me a word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He doesn't know," I said. "No-one knows. Please
don't tell him. I had thought of some day showing what
I had done to Uncle John Denton. But I've decided not
to, now. I didn't mean anyone to know&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wright picked up the paper and read the verse again.
I watched him, in a curious mental state. Part of me
resented bitterly that even so good a friend should have
dragged out to the revealing light of day, my wistful
secret of song: and yet, another part of me, back in my
brain, said dully, "It really doesn't matter&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"I'm a better critic than I am a poet," said Wright,
after a time. "I think you have a gift, Mavis. This,"
he flicked the paper with a thumb and finger, "has grace
and delicacy. It's not good, of course,&mdash;not according
to&mdash;well, say, Bill's standards,&mdash;but it has promise. I
won't tell Bill, if you'd rather not, although I think he
would help you a great deal&mdash;and I'm sure he'd go
quite out of his head with excitement. May I see, sometime,
anything else you have? Only, for the love of
Mike, what's the idea of being so morbid? Haven't you
happier things to write about, child?"</p>

<p>I put my hand over his,</p>

<p>"Sure you won't tell?" I begged.</p>

<p>"I swear, by all the Muses," he replied, "Bill shall
never know, from me."</p>

<p>"Know what?" asked Bill, appearing disconcertingly
around the tree.</p>

<p>I snatched my hand from Wright's and felt myself
grow scarlet. We must both have looked guilty, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Wright's guileless blonde face reflected my embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Secret!" said Wright, firmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>Bill glanced from one to the other of us, to the paper
in Wright's hand, and then considerately walked off.</p>

<p>"Lunch is ready," he remarked, over his shoulder.
"Been calling you for about ten minutes."</p>

<p>Wright helped me to my feet.</p>

<p>"Close call," he said.</p>

<p>"Hush!" I said, for my husband was still within
ear-shot.</p>

<p>"Is he always like that?" asked Wright, anxiously, as
we went toward the house.</p>

<p>"Like what?" I asked, in all innocence.</p>

<p>"Positively green-eyed with rage if you are alone for
half a minute with another man&mdash;even so harmless a
specimen as myself?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said I, with finality.</p>

<p>"I'm not, and if he is going to be jealous as all that,
why don't you get to him first before he can accuse you,
and demand that he cease baying at the moon with that
human leopardess who vamps around these diggings?"</p>

<p>"She'll be here this afternoon, on a visit," I announced,
laughing. "Why don't you monopolize her yourself?"</p>

<p>"I never went in for that kind," said Wright with firmness.
"I might get scratched. Gentle and soft-spoken,
that's my type. Besides, Miss Howells is going to look
just like her mother, and that's a warning to any man!"</p>

<p>That afternoon Mercedes arrived. Her bag proved to
be a trunk, and within an hour of her arrival, she had
charmed the kitchen, made eyes at Silas, called Wright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
by his first name, hurt her finger&mdash;with resultant medical
attention, and confided to me that she "hated men!"</p>

<p>After which, she departed in the direction of the palm-grove
with "Billy" and "Wright."</p>

<p>I went to her room and viewed her gowns, hanging,
like flowers, in her innovation steamer-trunk. After
which, I went to my own room and took stock of my
chiffon and satin armor.</p>

<p>Bill came back at tea time.</p>

<p>"Wright is reciting poetry to Mercedes on the stone
bench under the orchids, and sketching her between
verses," he announced, "but I crave more material food."</p>

<p>"You might have stayed on," I suggested, passing
him the sandwiches, "and made the recitation competitive."</p>

<p>"Competitive," he remarked, choosing a ripe, red disk
of tomato, flanked with thin circles of bread, and biting
into it reflectively, "calls for numbers. I don't enjoy
being part of a mob-scene, or a mass-meeting."</p>

<p>"Here comes the Meisters&auml;nger," I said, as Wright
came up the steps, with Mercedes unnecessarily on his
arm.</p>

<p>Selecting chairs, cups, plates and food, our guests
joined us around the wicker tea-wagon.</p>

<p>"He is not a nice young man at all," said Mercedes
frankly, exhibiting a rather clever little pastel of herself,
"this Wright. He says to me the most beautiful poetry,
so sad and so lovely, all about unrequited love and dead
girls floating in moonlit pools, and when, touched to the
heart, I weep a little, he laughs and says it is wonderful
how much tragedy one can turn out at fifty cents a line!"</p>

<p>She opened ocular fire on her host as she spoke, and
Bill responded nicely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure," he said gravely, "that Wright will have
plenty of happier inspiration now."</p>

<p>And said Wright to me, under his breath,</p>

<p>"In all justice, one must concede her a certain amount
of beauty. I don't think she's going to look like her
mother after all."</p>

<p>"Whispering's rude," said Mercedes severely, "isn't
it, Billy?"</p>

<p>So the conversation became general again.</p>

<p>At six, Bill drove over to the neighboring plantation to
fetch Peterkins, who had spent the day there with the
Crowell children, back to supper. When he returned,
he looked rather serious.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Wright idly, from the canvas
verandah swing.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," he answered, "that is, not yet. Run
along to Sarah, Peter,&mdash;there's a good fellow."</p>

<p>But I knew that something was wrong, and after the
child had left us, I asked quietly,</p>

<p>"Tell us, Bill, please!"</p>

<p>"Crowell's been having some trouble with the natives,"
he answered, frowning. "It may blow over&mdash;and
it may spread. They're like a lot of sheep. But I
feel responsible to Reynolds, even if Silas is in charge.
The people have a healthy respect for Silas, and they
trust him,&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What sort of trouble?" asked Wright, practically.</p>

<p>"Oh, threats&mdash;and little gatherings&mdash;and demonstrations.
They are always restless, and the slightest thing
sets them off. Crowell discharged one of his surliest
men the other day. Unfortunately, the chap is related
to half Guayabal. We've some of his cousins and
brothers and uncles on this place, I suppose! Anyway,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
this Miguel person has been going about trying to incite
the people to open enmity against the resident Americans.
Of course, it probably won't amount to a hill of beans,
but you never know where you stand."</p>

<p>"Haven't they just finished a comic-opera revolution
here?" asked Wright. "Seems to me I read something
about it."</p>

<p>"There are always uprisings," answered Mercedes,
covering a yawn, "generally in the eastern districts&mdash;nearer
Santiago. They are like children, these people."</p>

<p>She turned, with a shrug which dismissed the subject,
to Bill.</p>

<p>"Come," she urged prettily, "play my accompaniment
for me. I want to sing you some of the old songs my
little, Spanish grandmother taught her grandchildren."</p>

<p>We had a little while before we need dress for dinner,
and so Bill followed her obediently into the living-room,
and presently, her light, sweet voice floated out to Wright
and me on the verandah.</p>

<p>"Sings well, doesn't she?" said Wright.</p>

<p>But I was not attending.</p>

<p>"Doesn't Bill seem worried to you?" I asked, more
casually than my mental state warranted.</p>

<p>"Who? Bill? Why no, I don't think so," he answered,
absently. "He's probably put all this native
business out of his head by now. Bill's not an alarmist.
Wonder what that song is&mdash;quaint, isn't it?"</p>

<p>But I was not satisfied, and after dinner, I deliberately
found an opportunity, contrary to custom, to speak with
my husband alone.</p>

<p>"About the Crowell plantation," I said, "is there any
danger to them from the natives&mdash;to us?"</p>

<p>"There is always more or less danger," he answered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
with the formal courtesy which had recently characterized
all of our infrequent, unattended encounters, "but
I do not think we need worry. Still, I shall forbid Peter
to go out in the fields, or beyond the house alone, and
I must ask you also to be careful. I'm sorry to curtail
your freedom&mdash;but, if you don't mind&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Perversely, I suddenly "minded" very much.</p>

<p>"I won't run any risks," I answered, with mental reservations.</p>

<p>"There you two are again! Sneaking off, whispering,
heads together! Aren't you just a little tired of
twosing by now?"</p>

<p>It was Wright, coming up behind us. I thought I detected
a little, cynical gleam in Mercedes' eyes, and laid
my hand defiantly on Bill's arm.</p>

<p>"Are <i>you</i> tired?" I asked him gaily.</p>

<p>He laid his free hand over mine.</p>

<p>"Do men tire of life?" he counter questioned, gallantly,
and I knew a swift admiration for his histrionic
powers. For his voice went a little deep, quite suddenly,
and the hand over mine shook.</p>

<p>"Nice answer," said Wright critically, "quite emotional,
but open to argument. Of course men tire of life.
Some of them commit suicide, some of them drink, others
get married! The remedy is entirely according to temperament."</p>

<p>"Horrid man!" said Mercedes, pouting. And answering
amiably, "Am I not?" Wright guided her to the
bridge table, having persuaded her at dinner that, with
him as partner, she could trump his ace to her heart's
content.</p>

<p>As we followed them, Bill said, very low,</p>

<p>"Remember&mdash;not to go out alone, Mavis."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll remember," I answered, non-committally, and we
sat down to the cards.</p>

<p>It was interesting to observe that Mercedes, her previous
assertions to the contrary, played a much better
game than any of us, excepting, perhaps, Bill.</p>

<p>So, after all, it had been from choice and not lack of
knowledge, that she had not joined the game the night
of the dinner. Which looked as if someone else had
been manoeuvering besides myself. But I forgave her.
She was so pretty that one could not expect her to always
play quite "according to Hoyle."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XVI</p>

<p class="p2">I arrived in the kitchen the following morning, to discuss
luncheon with Norah, and found the entire kitchen-force
massed at the screened-door, watching Mercedes
coquetting with Arthur. There was a temptation to draw
an analogy between the brilliantly-plumaged, addle-pated
bird and the decorative girl who stood at the cage-door,
poking her white fingers perilously through the wiring
and cooing to him in softest Spanish. It must be admitted,
that weeks of painstaking effort on my part to
win Arthur to a display of friendliness toward me, had
resulted in nothing. But ten minutes with Mercedes
had proved his undoing: the bird was positively maudlin.
I came out to the cage, and at once the half-closed orbs
of Arthur underwent an unflattering change. He opened
them to their widest and bleakest and said, hoarsely sarcastic,
"Pretty darling! Darling! Bow-wow-wow!
Carramba!" at which Mercedes exclaimed delightedly,</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't he clever! Who taught him that?"</p>

<p>"The swearing, or the pet names?" I answered, stooping
to say goodmorning to Wiggles, "I haven't the remotest
idea."</p>

<p>"Billy?" suggested my guest, touching her perfectly
dressed hair with highly manicured finger-tips.</p>

<p>"Possibly," I answered. "He invariably barks and
then swears at me, before luncheon."</p>

<p>"Billy or Arthur?" inquired Mercedes with interest.</p>

<p>I laughed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you seen either of the men this morning?" I
asked. "I heard them go out early."</p>

<p>"They went to Crowell's," she answered. "I saw
them off. They will not be back before tea, Billy told
me."</p>

<p>I tried to look as if I had heard these plans before, and
merely forgotten them for a moment.</p>

<p>"How nice!" I said, insincerely, "We will have a nice,
long day together&mdash;with no disturbing male element,"
I added maliciously.</p>

<p>"I will like that too," said Mercedes, with great unexpectedness.
"You never let me talk to you alone, Mavis,
and" she finished with a funny little undercurrent of wistfulness
in her pretty voice, "I have no friends my own
age&mdash;women friends, I mean."</p>

<p>I had grown to be a little annoyed at my guest, but
somehow, her simple statement opened up a vista before
me which I had not dreamed existed. The child seemed,
after all, hungry for companionship. It was out of the
question that she should find it with her own indolent
mother, who treated her as if she were half plaything
and half infant; or with her father, whose attitude toward
her was a curious commingling of affectionate despotism
and anxiety: and the basis on which she met all her
many men-satellites was not one guaranteed to produce
comradeship.</p>

<p>I put my arm through hers and took her into the kitchen
with me. After my inconsiderable domestic task was
completed, we went out on the verandah together, armed
with sewing. Mercedes sewed beautifully, an art which
her early convent education had taught her, and I took a
real aesthetic pleasure in watching the smooth, dark head,
bent over the fine linen in her lap.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you making?" I asked her, idly.</p>

<p>She exhibited the very feminine garment: exquisitely
embroidered and sewn with the most exact and even of
tiny stitches.</p>

<p>"I wish I could sew like that," I said, enviously, "but
I should think you would ruin your eyes."</p>

<p>She raised to mine the tremendous pools of liquid darkness
in question.</p>

<p>"But no," she said. "All Spanish girls are clever with
the needle. The Sisters taught me when I was very
young."</p>

<p>I had been, with the Howells, to one of the convents
near Havana, and I recalled now the sweet, patient faces
of the nuns, and the marvelous work they showed us.
Some of it lay in one of my trunks now, a present to Mrs.
Goodrich from Bill and me. The thought of Mercedes
behind the austere cloister walls was incongruous.</p>

<p>"Were you long with the nuns?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Seven years," she answered, and then, amazingly, "I
was very happy there&mdash;for a long time I wanted to take
the veil, but Father was simply horrified at the idea."</p>

<p>I was somewhat horrified myself.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine it," I said flatly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>I didn't answer for a moment, and she went on,</p>

<p>"But I know why&mdash;you think me very light and
frivolous, do you not, Mavis?"</p>

<p>"It would be difficult," I answered cautiously, "to imagine
you as a nun!"</p>

<p>"They are good women," she said, and was silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly I realized that I knew very little more about
this girl than I had known on the boat coming down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Havana, and yet, I had been with her almost constantly
ever since.</p>

<p>"Didn't you care for college?" I inquired, rather diffidently.</p>

<p>Her great eyes lighted up.</p>

<p>"It was wonderful&mdash;in some ways&mdash;" she said slowly,
"so many girls, of all classes, gathered together. At
first I could not understand. At home, you know, one is
very careful whom one knows. It is changing a little
now. I remember I was scandalized, my first months at
college, to find that the President of the Senior class was
a waitress in one of the campus houses&mdash;actually waiting
on the table! It was too incredible! I wrote home, and
Mother begged Father to send for me at once. She was
even more shocked than I! But Father laughed, she
said, and told her it would do me good. He said it was
high time that a little of my American blood came to the
fore. Later I learned that this girl, the Senior President,
had practically worked her way through the four
years of college. She was the daughter of a very poor
man&mdash;a peasant, we would call him. And yet there was
hardly a girl in that great college who would not have
given everything she had for the respect and admiration
and love which that quiet, plain-featured girl had won
and held from students and faculty alike."</p>

<p>"You too?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I, too," said Mercedes simply. She bent her head a
little lower over the white fabric in her lap and went on,
not quite clearly. "I was not very popular. Some liked
me, yes. They even asked me to their homes for the
shorter vacations. But they liked me because I was
'different': because it was 'smart' to say that they had
a Spanish-American girl as a friend: or because I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
pretty and bright and did not care much to study. But I
made no real friendships."</p>

<p>I was, by now, very interested. Here was a cross-section
of life that I had no knowledge of. A feeling of
sympathy stirred in me: this gay, alien little creature,
with the blood of two widely dissimilar nations warring
in her, coming fresh from her convent to the democratic
freedom of an American college. I said,</p>

<p>"Tell me a little about it all, Mercedes. I only know
college-life second hand, for, as perhaps Bill has told
you, I was a helpless invalid for eleven years. But I was
fortunate in my friends, although I had few of my own
age, and in a Father who was my greatest playfellow and
my most understanding comrade."</p>

<p>The quick, facile tears rose to the big eyes. She pulled
her chair a little closer and laid her warm, vibrant hand
on mine.</p>

<p>"I didn't know," she said. "I'm so sorry. Billy told
me that you had been ill&mdash;but I didn't dream.&mdash;You're
wonderful, Mavis," she said, "delicate and lovely as an
orchid. I always feel clumsy and too highly-colored beside
you. And you have been so kind and sweet&mdash;"</p>

<p>I grew very remorseful: my feelings toward Mercedes
Howells had been anything but "kind and sweet." They
had been distinctly critical and almost unfriendly. For
the first time, I did not resent her easy use of my husband's
given name: for the first time I realized the old
truth that to know people is to like them.</p>

<p>I gave the narrow, high-bred hand a little squeeze.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, child," I said lightly. "And tell me
more about your American impressions."</p>

<p>"You sound just like the reporter who came on the
boat, my first trip North," said Mercedes, with a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
giggle. "Such a nice young man! But the things he
put in the paper about me! 'Beautiful Spanish-American
heiress screams with delight at the first glimpse of
her father's country.' I didn't really scream," she explained
conscientiously, "but I talked more than I should
have. Father wrote me quite an angry letter about it.
He is very well known," she added, without pride, "and
it annoyed him. He says no woman can hold her tongue,
anyway! But how was I to know that the nice young
man was a reporter?"</p>

<p>I had a vision of Mercedes, hands flying, eyes everywhere,
babbling and bubbling for the <i>New York Press</i>.
It was too amusing. No wonder Mr. Howells had been
'annoyed.'</p>

<p>"Go on," I said encouragingly.</p>

<p>"The girls I went home with," she said, after a while,
"they lived in wonderful houses and had such beautiful
clothes. But I didn't like them, somehow. You see, at
home we are very strictly brought up. After a girl is
out, she has some freedom, of course, and, after she marries,
it is quite different&mdash;she can do as she likes. And
until Father had insisted upon my being educated in the
States, my Mother had had all the care of me. And I
was brought up as the Spanish girls are, as my Mother
was in her own Madrid. These American girls I visited
thought of nothing but good times. They spoke no language
but their own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How many do you speak, Mercedes?" I interrupted,
curiously.</p>

<p>"English, Spanish, French, of course," she answered,
"and a little smattering of Italian and German. I had
governesses until I was ten, and then I went to the convent.
And much emphasis was laid on languages."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>I suppressed a gasp, and she went on.</p>

<p>"It was from them&mdash;my college friends&mdash;that I
learned that it is easy to deceive one's parents. And that
it is quite right and proper to have as many cavaliers as
one can. 'Scalp-hunting' they called it&mdash;"</p>

<p>I thought of Mercedes' not inadept efforts along the
line of scalps, and thinking, asked,</p>

<p>"But haven't Spanish girls&mdash;and girls all over the
world&mdash;very much the same ambitions along that line?"</p>

<p>Mercedes knitted her brows, and as she looked at me,
I was startled, for, for the first time, I saw in her a very
definite resemblance to her father. There was a strength
of jaw there, to which the rounded, soft chin had blinded
me: a certain Northern keenness in the Southern eyes.</p>

<p>"Why yes," she answered, "but it is&mdash;to marry that
they&mdash;shall I say&mdash;hunt? But it was not that with
my New York friends. They had no desire to marry:
many of them told me that they would hate being tied
down, that they disliked children. No, it was not to
marry&mdash;but merely to play and to be amused&mdash;"</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"It's the motive then," I said, "that makes the difference
in your eyes?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she said frankly. "To marry, to have
a family, to be mistress in one's own home, that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The legitimate ambition of every woman," I concluded
for her.</p>

<p>"Si, Senora," she answered, laughing in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"But," I argued, "you must have met other American
girls whose interest was not solely centered in the fine art
of flirtation."</p>

<p>"I understood them&mdash;those you speak of, even less!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
said Mercedes guilelessly. "My roommate was such a
one. She wanted to be an engineer just fancy! And she
was so pretty too!"</p>

<p>"An engineer!" I ejaculated, for even to my American
mind this was an unusual ambition for my sex to harbor.
"And she had no use for men, too?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That was just it," said Mercedes, in obvious wonderment.
"She had any number of men friends: corresponded
with them, saw them at dances: they even called
upon her at college. But a flirt she was not. They were
her friends, she said. And she was like another boy
with them. I went to her home once, a little town in
Massachusetts, and I could not understand her at all.
She was like a sister to her mother, a son to her father,
and a comrade to her dance-partners. It was too amazing!"</p>

<p>There was the whole thing in a nutshell, I thought.
She could understand but not condone the promiscuous
flirtations of her American sisters: but the girl who was
comrade to a man, and friend, and who looked on him as
such, and not as an extra "scalp" or a possible husband,
was beyond her comprehension.</p>

<p>"But," I argued, "returning to the butterflies, surely,
Mercedes, you have quite as much freedom now as any
American girl. And, forgive me, my dear, but you employ
it in much the same manner."</p>

<p>Her glance was mischievous and rather child-like.</p>

<p>"That has only been since my return home," she said.
"Mother is not pleased, but Father says, 'let her go
ahead.' And&mdash;as to what you say, I am trying very
hard to be American now."</p>

<p>"Not the comrade sort, such as your mechanical roommate?"
I suggested.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>She regarded me in amazement.</p>

<p>"But most of the men I meet are Cubans," she stated.
"Do you think <i>they</i> would understand it&mdash;if I could be
like that little Mary Adams?"</p>

<p>I considered, shook my head.</p>

<p>"Of course not," she said, answering her own question.
"They would laugh and shrug&mdash;and be, perhaps, disagreeable.
They can accept such a manner in an American
girl. They do not like it, or comprehend it, but some
of them have learned their lesson. And they must respect
it. But&mdash;in a Spanish girl&mdash;it would be unthinkable.
Besides," she added frankly, "I couldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was right. Temperamentally unfit, emotionally
too highly developed.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;as to the flirting," she said shyly, "I&mdash;I like
to attract people. I like to make them laugh and say
nice things. And perhaps my American friends have
taught me something of their methods."</p>

<p>"And your motive&mdash;?" I asked.</p>

<p>She stretched her graceful arms wide. Her hair had a
blue sheen in the shaded light of the verandah and her
skin was magnolia-white.</p>

<p>"I haven't any!" said Mercedes frankly.</p>

<p>"Not even a small gold band in the perspective?" I
said.</p>

<p>She looked down at her ringless hands: at the heap of
fragrant linen lying in her lap.</p>

<p>"This is to be part of my trousseau," she answered,
indirectly, "part of what you call a 'Hope Chest.' All
girls of my class sew a great deal and lay it all away until
they marry. And, after all, I am not like my New York
cousins, for where they say 'perhaps&mdash;when I get tired
of playing,' I say, 'someday, when I meet the right man.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
And so, you see, I am not like my Mother's people either&mdash;not
quite. For they say, 'someday when my parents
are satisfied&mdash;and let us hope it will be soon!'"</p>

<p>I didn't wonder that Bill&mdash;that the men found her
charming. The mixture of innocence and sophistication,
the innate and the acquired worldliness was really delicious.</p>

<p>"Do you talk to many people like this?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Of course not," she answered, wide-eyed. "I know
of no one who would understand. There are times," she
admitted, with a little sigh, "When I really do not understand
myself."</p>

<p>At the luncheon table I found myself looking at Mercedes,
half as if she were a stranger, half as if she were an
old friend.</p>

<p>"I envy you and Bill, Mavis," she said, once, when
Fong had left the room, "you have so much to make you
happy. He's a very lucky man."</p>

<p>I smiled. It was not a subject on which I wished to be
interrogated.</p>

<p>"And you," she went on, "are a lucky girl. He's
awfully fine, that husband of yours."</p>

<p>She played for a moment with her tea-spoon, and
looked at me, rather pathetically.</p>

<p>"I like the way American men are with their wives,"
she said, "I wish I could have met a Billy&mdash;"</p>

<p>I might have responded that, in a few months' time, my
husband would be legally free to take an interest in such
remarks, but I refrained.</p>

<p>"You must have met a number of men, in two years,"
I said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"Not Billies," she answered firmly, "awfully young
they were, and&mdash;" she paused.</p>

<p>Fong came in just then, and the conversation took a
more discreet turn. After luncheon, siesta-ing in the two
big swings down among the palms, I brought up the subject
again.</p>

<p>"So, after all," I said, "the 'right man' must be an
American, Mercedes?"</p>

<p>I had not calculated on the effect of my idle words. A
vivid scarlet spread to the roots of the black hair.</p>

<p>"On the boat," she answered, "we talked, your Bill
and I&mdash;and since then, also. And I have learned a little
of the reverence for women that your fine men have:
a little of the way they guard and protect them&mdash;not by
bars and bolts and commands, but by love and chivalry
and thoughtfulness. I have seen that too, in my Father,
a little. But, after all, my Father married Mother, and
so, it is different with him. And he has never talked to
me as he would to the daughter, perhaps, of an American
wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>I thought of my own Father and knew a swift pang
of pity, for this rather rudderless little craft.</p>

<p>"It was through Billy that I got to know you," Mercedes
went on&mdash;"he was always talking about you. And
you&mdash;you always held me off&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something very warm and sweet crept into my heart,
and I put my hand out, across the space between.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said, "awfully sorry, Mercedes,&mdash;you
see, perhaps I wasn't quite used to girls."</p>

<p>"You'll really be my friend now?" she asked, na&iuml;vely:
and I was conscious that I spoke the whole truth as I
answered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"I am your friend, Mercedes,&mdash;never doubt it."</p>

<p>Our hands clasped on that, and within ten minutes, her
quiet breathing told me that she slept. I lay awake a
little longer, thinking very hard. So Bill had really seen
the best of her after all. He had not told me, for I had
never tried to know, even second hand. He would have
let me go on believing the girl to be heartless and silly,
and admiration-loving, nothing else. It was not fair!
And then I stopped to realize that I had not <i>wanted</i> to
believe her anything else. Before I fell asleep, I had
absolved Mercedes Howells from deliberately trying to
flirt with my husband. She would have been my friend
more than his, had I wished her to be. Failing that, she
had turned to the person, who, oddly enough, had apparently
comprehended her little complexities. I looked
over at the serene face, the heavy, white lids, with their
weight of dark lashes, folded over the big eyes. A little
smile curved the lovely, full mouth, and she slept, as a
child sleeps, one hand under her soft cheek.</p>

<p>It was very still. The palm leaves rustled faintly over
my head, and the sunlight fell hot and golden through the
trees. My eyes closed in spite of myself, and with a very
tender impulse toward my new friend, I turned on my
side and slept.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XVII</p>

<p class="p2">"What are you two girls whispering about?" asked
Wright, coming up behind us on the glassed-in porch of
the Country Club.</p>

<p>"It is none of your affairs," responded Mercedes with
dignity, "but as you are so rude as to ask, I will tell you
that the last affair of the season is to be held at the home
of Consuelo Mendez&mdash;a ball&mdash;next week. And I have
asked Mavis if she will let me steal you for the evening&mdash;provided
you have no objection. It will be amusing, I
think, and you will meet many pretty girls."</p>

<p>"As to that, I would not have to leave Guayabal," said
Wright politely, "but I am honored that you implore my
escort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Implore!" said Mercedes with scorn.</p>

<p>"Be careful," I warned. "She'll withdraw her invitation.
And I'm sure you'd have a wonderful time. I
shan't go, of course, although Senora Mendez has been
gracious enough to include me in the invitation. And
Bill declares he is too old for such festivities. But I have
told Mercedes she may have you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And welcome?" suggested Wright, tragically.</p>

<p>"I shall stop on at 'The Palms' till then," said Mercedes&mdash;"Mavis
has asked me. And if you will come
into Havana with me the day of the dance, my Mother
will be very glad to have you stay with us over that
night. For it will be a late party, of course&mdash;too late for
you to return to Guayabal."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>"Bully," said Wright with enthusiasm, "I'd love it.
What does one wear?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Low neck and short sleeves," answered Bill, appearing
from the locker rooms.</p>

<p>"Wright thinks," said Mercedes pensively, "that at
an affair almost entirely within the Spanish-Cuban set,
the gentlemen appear attired as <i>toreodores</i>."</p>

<p>Wright looked aggrieved.</p>

<p>"Not at all," he contradicted, "only the Anglo-Saxon
fashions for men are utterly devoid of beauty. I wish
I had lived some time back&mdash;in the satin knee-breeches
and lace cuff period."</p>

<p>"But you're bow-legged!" objected Bill insultingly.</p>

<p>"I am not," said Wright indignantly. "Observe!"
He thrust out a far from unshapely calf, in tweed knickers.
"If my extremities show a slight tendency to bow,
it is merely a sign of physical strength, and many years
spent in the saddle and on the base-ball diamond."</p>

<p>Said Mercedes to me, in an aside.</p>

<p>"Now, you know, my Mother would never have listened
to such a discussion&mdash;in Madrid!"</p>

<p>"She would never have had the opportunity," I whispered
back.</p>

<p>"To return to the Mendez ball," said Wright, raising
his voice, with intent. "I thought a simple flower in my
hair or thrust into my waistcoat...."</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> an ass!" remarked Bill, yawning.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," conceded Wright pleasantly, "but it is a
quality which keeps me much in demand."</p>

<p>"You will never," said Bill deliberately, "get very far
in your work, old man. For one thing&mdash;you have too
much money: for another, you take nothing seriously."</p>

<p>"How about yourself?" asked Wright, a little stirred.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>Bill glanced at Mercedes, but she smiled at him and
nodded.</p>

<p>"I have found out about you, Billy," she said,
"So go ahead and talk."</p>

<p>"Who told you?" demanded my husband, not very
angrily.</p>

<p>"Partly Wright&mdash;I wormed it out of him, after he
had let something slip&mdash;and, more recently, Mavis."</p>

<p>"Mavis!" said Bill in astonishment.</p>

<p>I did not meet his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Mercedes. "She is bursting with
pride in you, naturally. <i>Cela va sans dire!</i> So, after I
had probed and begged a little, she let me see the book.
It is very wonderful," she ended, with that utter lack of
self-consciousness in expressing her emotions and opinions,
which, after one was used to it, was rather endearing.</p>

<p>"Well, then, as you're among friends, Billy, I repeat,
what about yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have my profession," Bill answered quietly. "I am
a doctor&mdash;and I love it. It is, perhaps, my vocation&mdash;to
heal and to mend, and to help. And equally, perhaps,
poetry is my avocation."</p>

<p>"Dictionary definition of avocation is 'diversion,'"
said Wright, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"And the definition of diversion is 'recreation'!" I
put in.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Bill, "re-creation. To create anew&mdash;to
refresh. That is, perhaps, the mission of poetry,
and applies to the poet as well as to his audience. Poetry
is, for me, the language of dreams: the ceaseless search
for beauty: something common to all men. For the peasant
dreams as well as the inventor: the man of science,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
as well as the financier and the college professor who
thinks of education as something bigger than is contained
between the covers of a text-book. And from the soil,
the shop, the laboratory, the office and the school-room
great songs have been sung,&mdash;not all of them in
words!"</p>

<p>"The financier dreams?" said Wright, incredulously.
"Not much!"</p>

<p>"If he didn't, he wouldn't be where he is," answered
Bill. "If the engineer didn't dream, the bridges would
not be swung over the boiling rivers of strange countries,
or the railroad tracks laid through the virgin jungle and
the ageless desert&mdash;"</p>

<p>I had a curious sensation, listening to that even, low
voice. It was as if, for the first time, I had heard Richard
Warren speak.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," said the other man, after a moment
of silence.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," answered Bill. "And so, the poets
dream dreams too, and try to interpret other men's
dreams: those which are built in brick and stone: materialized
into steel: founded in a huge office building.
The grim reality of war stands for dreams sometimes.
Many inarticulate poets have gone singing to the bayonet
thrust. Once, a handful of people dreamed of Liberty;
and the United States was their expression of that dream."</p>

<p>Someone drew a deep breath. It was I, perhaps.</p>

<p>Bill looked over at me, shaking the ash from his cigarette.
And for a moment I forgot the feud between us:
forgot that we were very soon to go our separate ways:
forgot a number of things that I had known and I remembered
only the songs that Richard Warren had sung
for the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a dream, too," said Mercedes, "which made
Cuba free!"</p>

<p>We were grave, as, together, we four had never been
through the sunny, idle days. I had the oddest feeling
that between us all lay something unspoken, unnamed, intangible,
as if, too, for the moment, we were closely knit
together, completely <i>en rapport</i>.</p>

<p>"Well," said Wright easily, swinging the conversation
back to its starting place, "It's all very well to talk. And
perhaps you are more serious than I, Bill. Mind, I don't
altogether admit it&mdash;but you tune your lyre to a deeper
key than I do mine. I can't claim to be a poet: a versifier,
yes...."</p>

<p>"You do yourself an injustice," I said warmly, for
Wright's somewhat exotic pen-name had long since come
into my knowledge and I had seen some of his magazine
verse.</p>

<p>"You've a gift," said my husband, "not lightly to be
disregarded. But you're too versatile&mdash;you paint better
than you write, and there's a lot in the old parable of the
talents. And, by George, you've no honest right to your
talent if, in some way, you do not use it for the good of
your fellow-men."</p>

<p>"That's what I tell him," broke in Mercedes, in a little
earnest note, and blushed a rosy red.</p>

<p>The links were almost deserted, and the tea-hour long
past. Realizing that it would be late before we reached
home, I rose, reluctantly. For there had been a spirit
around the table which could not easily be recaptured&mdash;and
I regretted its passing.</p>

<p>"The tourists have practically all left," said Mercedes,
on the way to the car. "Very few are here still. And
the residents have already begun to go North."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll practise again this year?" asked Wright of
Bill, as the car drove off, and I heard my husband answer,</p>

<p>"That depends very much on Mavis."</p>

<p>"Is he to poetize or administer pills?" asked Wright,
turning to me.</p>

<p>"Both, I hope," I answered casually. "Good doctors
may not be as rare as good poets, but the combination is
remarkable."</p>

<p>"I should think," said Mercedes, with candour, "that
you would be awfully jealous...."</p>

<p>"Grateful lady patients?" asked Wright.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I've not had the opportunity yet," I answered.
"Since I've known him Bill hasn't had many patients except
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite a serious case," remarked Wright solemnly,
"one that demands incessant medical attention."</p>

<p>Bill laughed.</p>

<p>"If Mavis can stand for irregular hours and cold
meals," he said, "I'll start in again when our vacation is
over."</p>

<p>"You needn't rub it into me that I don't have to work
for a living," said Wright. "Look at you, taking a year
off, careless-like. 'Tisn't decent&mdash;for a doctor. I can't
help it that my late lamented uncle made tin-pans successfully&mdash;and
that I was his only living relative. He
didn't approve of me at all," he concluded modestly, "and
he thought my verses immoral, but he couldn't leave it all
to charity, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've never lacked having more money than I needed,"
said Bill, as we drove through the hot, quiet night, "but
I've been glad of it. If it didn't provide me with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
added incentive to work, it at least allowed me to do a
good deal that I otherwise could not have done."</p>

<p>"The Denton Free Clinic, for instance," said Wright.
But Bill did not answer.</p>

<p>For just a second I was hurt that he hadn't told me.
And then I remembered how little I knew about the man
who was my husband.</p>

<p>Mercedes, in the front seat with Bill, asked him a
question. Under the cover of their voices Wright said
to me,</p>

<p>"I shouldn't chaff Bill like that. I don't suppose that
there is another medico of his age in New York who has
done so much charity-doctoring. There are districts
where the people have absolutely canonized him."</p>

<p>"He never tells me about that side of it," I said.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he would," answered Wright. "You
get to know these things by chance. But he had a streak
in him&mdash;even at Princeton&mdash;that made him different
from the rest of us. And men who were with him at
Johns Hopkins could tell you tales&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bridge tonight?" said Mercedes.</p>

<p>I jumped. My thoughts had been very far away, filling
in gaps.</p>

<p>"You'll have to play with me," said Wright. "I understand
all your signals, Mercedes!"</p>

<p>"But you don't profit by them," she answered, as we
came within sight of the house.</p>

<p>I played a wretched game that evening. I couldn't keep
my mind on the cards. It was off&mdash;back at the Country
Club again, listening to a poet talk of poets: it was wondering
a little about the "Denton Free Clinic": and, in
consequence, I revoked twice, to the extreme amusement
of our opponents.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't come to the point where you swear at your
wife at the bridge-table, have you Bill?" asked Wright,
as he carefully took the penalty.</p>

<p>"No," replied my husband, "that's a form of indoor
sport I could never quite understand. It doesn't seem
fair&mdash;for she couldn't swear back."</p>

<p>"Oh, couldn't I?" said I with ardour.</p>

<p>"I shan't give you the opportunity," he answered.
"And now, if you please, one no trump."</p>

<p>The game broke up rather early. I was tired and
wanted to go to bed. Wright and Mercedes, with the
excuse that they were keenly interested in astronomy,
walked out on the verandah. I told them good-night.</p>

<p>"You'll stay to chaperone the Irresponsibles?" I asked
my husband.</p>

<p>"Gladly," he said, "and discreetly&mdash;from a distance."</p>

<p>There was something so comfortable and lovable about
him that night that I suddenly wanted to tell him I was
sorry that we had quarrelled, sorry that the barrier had
arisen between us. But I couldn't. In one way, however,
I might make amends. I said,</p>

<p>"I've grown awfully fond of Mercedes. I hope she
will come North sometime&mdash;for the summer, perhaps.
I think I misjudged her cruelly for a while."</p>

<p>The steel-blue eyes grew warm.</p>

<p>"She's a very nice child," said Bill, "and I knew you'd
find it out before long. You didn't give her a chance at
first. But I'm glad you like her, Mavis, for you can do
her a lot of good."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, you're pretty well balanced&mdash;most
of the time. And for another, you have had the
advantage of a unique and splendid upbringing. And for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
another, you are&mdash;unless given certain circumstances&mdash;most
uncommonly sweet."</p>

<p>He said it in a very matter-of-fact tone: and looked at
his watch as he spoke&mdash;not at me. I was absurdly embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;are you a 'certain circumstance'?" I asked
daringly, and escaped to my room before he could answer.
I heard him start to follow me, but apparently he
thought better of it. But long after I was in bed, I heard
a foot-fall under my windows, the smell of a pipe drifted
in through the flower-scent, and the sound of a baritone
voice singing softly,</p>

<p>"Who is Sylvia&mdash;who is she&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Is she kind as she is fair&mdash;?"</p>

<p>I lay for some time, listening, and finally, as the footsteps
turned away and the song grew fainter, I laid my
hot cheek to the pillow and slept, dreamlessly, until morning.</p>

<p>But when morning came, it all seemed very far away&mdash;that
talk at the Country Club&mdash;and the steps below
my window. Wright was in his silliest mood, and Mercedes
and he kept up a running fire of foolishness. Bill
was preoccupied, almost abrupt. He left us directly after
lunch, on one of his now daily visits to the Crowell plantation.
And Mercedes disappeared with Wright at the
same time. Where they were, I do not know to this
day.</p>

<p>I had tea alone: Peter was with Sarah, and after tea
I went out restlessly and walked, stopping at old Manuel's
and at Annunciata's. It was growing dark before I
turned homewards again, and there was a strange lingering
light in the sky which drew my attention. A great,
sulphur-colored cloud, murky and ominous, not like any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
cloud I had ever seen. I hurried on and had reached the
gates before the wind came. A rush, a tearing at trees
and bushes, a tremendous sweep of hot, choking dust and
air. I could hardly keep my feet, and struggled, step by
step, head down, almost defenceless in the face of the
storm. The wind had risen, apparently, without warning.
And yet, looking back on it afterwards, I realized
that, had I been a little more familiar with the vagaries
of Cuban climate, I would have noticed the curious hush,
the absolute stillness, expectant and breathless, which lay
over Guayabal just before the storm broke. Nearing the
house, I heard a tremendous crash, voices, and the sound
of hurrying foot-steps. The wind was increasing in volume,
and I fairly stumbled up the steps, almost falling.
When my hand was finally on the door, it was wrenched
open with violence, and I saw Bill on the threshold, very
white, with burning blue eyes.</p>

<p>He caught me by the arm and pulled me into the
room.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he said, furiously.</p>

<p>"Walking," said I, the ruins of my hat in my hand.</p>

<p>He made a sound in his throat, half-anger, half-impotence.</p>

<p>"The roof of the garage has blown off," he said. "It's
a nice little storm. I have been looking for you all over
the plantation. No one had any idea where you were.
I found Wright and sent Mercedes in the house&mdash;she's
had rather a narrow escape&mdash;from a falling tree. She's
all right, but hysterical&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must go to her at once," I said, starting off.</p>

<p>The long arm shot out and I was pulled close to the
tall, lean figure.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," said Bill. "Mercedes is all right,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
as I said. Sarah is with her. But I want to ask you
this ... quite aside from the danger you ran, in a wind
like this, why did you disobey my express wishes and go
out&mdash;alone&mdash;away from the house?"</p>

<p>Then I remembered.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said I, and was silent.</p>

<p>Bill dropped my arm.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said with bitterness, "it was because
I asked you not to. Very well, I've learned my lesson.
You knew that Guayabal is in a very unsettled state: you
knew that Crowell had had trouble on his plantation: I
told you there had been threats&mdash;demonstrations. I
asked you not to run any risks. That is why, I suppose,
when the opportunity arose, you deliberately ignored my
wishes."</p>

<p>"You are very unjust," I said, fighting back the tears.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Bill quietly, "but I'm afraid not. It
seems as if we couldn't have a whole day of peace and
friendliness under the same roof. I've tried my best,
Mavis, to be as little in your way as possible&mdash;to make
the best of a trying situation. But at every turn you
manage to antagonize me and to rebel against me. I might
have known&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned away and lighted a cigarette with fingers
which shook.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said, steadying my voice with an effort,
"if I have annoyed you. I did not go out this afternoon
with such intention."</p>

<p>I would have stopped there, but the lift of his shoulders
angered me until I finally lost all control of myself.</p>

<p>"I'll not be a burden to you long," I said. "As soon
as we are home again I will release you from your responsibilities.
I have wanted to spare Father, but I see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
that I can't&mdash;you go too far. I don't know how such
things are done, but it shouldn't be very difficult to obtain
an annulment of our marriage. The whole thing has
been a ghastly mistake ... an impulse I have regretted
ever since. But it's not too late," I said, with my head
held very high, "to rectify that mistake."</p>

<p>I walked past him into my own room. Somehow the
pride that had always come to my rescue was missing
now. I was just hurt&mdash;hurt, and unhappy and very
lonely. To speak to me so! To look at me so, out of
those steel-blue eyes! It was not just; it was not anything
but deliberate cruelty!</p>

<p>Once having said that I would make myself free, the
thing crystalized for me as it had never done before.
Of course, I had meant all along to separate from my
temporary husband. That was understood at the outset.
But it had seemed a long way off, indefinitely vague.
And now that my decision was spoken, it loomed very
near. Irrevocable. I shrank, in anticipation, from the
publicity of it, the questions, the prying eyes. Wright
would wonder and grieve&mdash;and Mercedes&mdash;and I? I
hardly knew. On Father's sorrow and self-reproach I
dared not dwell. Now I had nothing left.</p>

<p>I rose and bathed my eyes. They were swollen from
crying and my throat ached abominably. And then, with
a tremendous effort, I opened my door and went out to
find Mercedes.</p>

<p>She was in her room, shaken but quite recovered, and
full of gratitude to Wright for seeing her danger and
pulling her away just in time.</p>

<p>"Where were you?" she asked anxiously. "You
weren't hurt, were you? You look dreadfully, Mavis!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>Hurt? Yes, I was hurt beyond healing. But Mercedes
must not know.</p>

<p>"I was in no danger," I said, evasively. "I came in
just as the storm was beginning."</p>

<p>"You heard the roof go then?" she asked. "Wasn't
it awful? It is a wonder Bill wasn't killed&mdash;he was just
driving the car in...."</p>

<p>"Bill?" I said, stupidly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Didn't he tell you? You're
white as a sheet!"</p>

<p>She jumped up from the bed and put her arms about
me.</p>

<p>"Mavis, are you faint? Let me call Bill!"</p>

<p>"Please don't," I said. "I'm all right now."</p>

<p>The dreadful dizziness had passed: my ears stopped
singing and the room assumed its normal aspect again.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," I said, "I'll lie down beside you
for a bit. Please don't tell anyone. I'm nervous, I suppose,
and upset."</p>

<p>And so, it was in Mercedes Howells' arms that I finally
cried myself into calmness. And Mercedes, suddenly
tender and very gentle, never asked why, and, bless her
heart, never told.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XVIII</p>

<p class="p2">A day or so went by, devoid of any particular incident.
If Bill and I spoke to each other at all, it was to discuss
our plans for leaving Cuba. The Goodriches were returning
shortly from Europe: Father sent a homesick-for-me
cable from Green Hill: the weather was beginning
to grow very warm: in short, a hundred and one
things warned us that the Spring were better spent in the
North. We fixed our departure for a day not two weeks
distant, and Bill went into Havana to book our passage.
Even in public we had dropped the pretence of marital
banter. But Wright and Mercedes, apparently absorbed
in each other, did not notice: or, if they did, kept each his
and her own counsel, as far as I knew.</p>

<p>The lazy, sun-steeped days seemed interminable. I
had, luckily, a number of things to arrange&mdash;another
trunk to buy and some sewing to accomplish, with Annunciata's
help. And Bill's obvious preoccupation could
easily have been laid to the growing unrest in Guayabal.
Mr. Crowell, an anxious, nervous, but charming person,
had been more than once at "The Palms" to discuss the
situation. If it had not been for my husband's sense of
responsibility towards the Reynolds, I think that we
should have packed up and left Cuba in short order. But
he was anxious to stay on for a time longer and see Silas,
and what men were loyal to their American employer,
through what he hoped would prove a passing phase of
revolt&mdash;or so he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>As for me, I went through the days, weighted under
a burden of uncertainty and a sorrow without name.
Father's miniature, lying open on my night-table, seemed
to reproach me: seemed, too, at times, to reproach himself,
which was even harder to bear. "I have done my
human best for you," the gentle-strong mouth seemed to
say. "I have never wanted anything but your happiness,
my little Mavis." And the kind, humorous eyes added,
"Is it my fault that I must hear you sobbing through
these long, unhappy nights?"</p>

<p>No, not his fault. Whose, then? I dared not ask the
picture in the little leather case, for I was afraid it might
answer.</p>

<p>"It is <i>his</i> fault, Father," I would defend myself mutely.
"We might have been content, even happy, in a friendly
way, if it had not been for him."</p>

<p>"It was not for Friendship alone that I gave you to
him, Daughter," the answer would come, "but for something
dearer, bigger, deeper. You were so young and
so alien from the world. I had thought that the man to
whom we both owe everything would be the one to help
you through all that first difficult time: to teach you, finally,
Life's loveliest lesson. And I had hoped, prayed
even, that you would one day come to be to him what your
Mother was to me.... There was not much time," the
beloved voice went on, very sadly, "for me to make a
decision. It was hard to feel I might have to leave you
... alone ... unsheltered.... How hard, you will
never know ... unless some day you are called upon to
leave a child of your own...."</p>

<p>"Father!" I begged&mdash;"Please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If the mistake was mine," said the voice which still
seemed to come from that unsmiling miniature, "I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
only ask your forgiveness, Mavis. Even your Father,
who loves you beyond all earthly things, was wrong to
try and shape your destiny."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;" I sobbed.</p>

<p>I laid the minature on the table again. The voice in my
heart had ceased to speak: There were only the pictured
eyes, looking into mine from a little leather case.
But for a long time, Father had talked to me so. I read
between the lines of his letters and prayed that he should
not read between the lying phrases of mine. Was it all
lies? "I am happy," I told him again and again: and
he, who knew me so well, was convinced, perhaps
because, in a certain, curious sense, that much was
true.</p>

<p>Underneath bewilderment, misunderstanding, the pinpricks
of pride, and the smart of old resentments, I <i>had</i>
been happy. It was as if I walked on a strange, new
road, toward some unknown goal, some unguessed shelter.
There were turnings in the path: dark places: uneven
stretches: but always a bird sang, sweetly, in the distance,&mdash;the
sun cleared the clouds and Adventure waited
for me just around the corner. But lately, the ground
had fallen away from under my very feet, and left me
standing at the edge of an abyss, looking across a chasm
of despair, to the far country I would never reach....</p>

<p>Mercedes knocked at my door, and came in.</p>

<p>"You've been away so long," she said, reproachfully.
"Wright is going to mass with me, in the Church at
Ceube. Won't you come too, Mavis?"</p>

<p>It's Sunday then, I thought, wondering how the days
had passed, nameless and unheeded by me&mdash;every one
bringing me nearer&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure you want me?" I asked, and at her assurance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
I got my hat and set out with her and Wright in the car.</p>

<p>Bill drove us down: he didn't come in, but went about
other business after he had left us at the little church,
solidly built of time and weather stained adobe, red-roofed,
and squatly towered.</p>

<p>The small room was filled with people. We squeezed
into an already overcrowded pew, and kneeling, I was almost
drugged with the clouds of incense, and the hot,
close air.</p>

<p>At the altar, the red-robed priest, very old and frail,
intoned the ceremonial service. A full-grown altar-"boy,"
black as his robes, and slippered, swung the heavy
censer, and looked over the audience for possible disturbances.
They occurred more than once. The brown
babies cooed or cried, according to their several temperaments;
a mongrel dog ran in and out of the pews, at a
late-comer's heels; and here and there, a black-eyed girl
looked over her shoulder at some responsive cavalier who
stood or knelt with the many worshippers lining the walls.</p>

<p>There was an amazing, almost tangible spirit in the
place: a mingling of childlike devotion and equally childlike
theatricalism. The people came to the service, like
children to a parent, wholly natural, wholly simple, and
yet not wholly devoid of a certain dramatic instinct and,
above all, keenly sensitive to the sweet-scented vapor, the
well-worn lace and vestments of the priest, the solemn
intonation of the Mass.</p>

<p>Bright-winged birds flew astonishingly in and out of
the open-shuttered windows: the consumptive organ
wheezed and muttered: the voices of the people rose with
a grave eagerness upon the heavy air. And here and
there an adventurous ray of sunshine fell alike on old
and young heads, lingered on the gay colors of the girls'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
dresses, slid like a finger of gold over the red-robed priest
at the little altar, and danced across the heavy, smoky
rafters of the ceiling.</p>

<p>Mercedes, her lovely face hidden, told her silver and
pearl rosary. Wright, after his first moment of embarrassment
and instinctive recoil from so much massed
humanity, was engrossed in her, in his surroundings. I
imagined I saw a picture shaping&mdash;a little more tender,
a little more serious than anything he had done yet. And
I, kneeling in the stuffy chapel with an alien people of a
different expression of Faith, felt for the first time in
many, many hours, a sense of release, of peace, a cooling
touch on my hot and aching heart.</p>

<p>Mass over, the people poured, laughing, talking, gesticulating
out into the thick, yellow sunshine. The half-flirtations
which had deflected the thoughts of some of
the younger worshippers, were renewed and pursued. A
young mother sat on the steps of the church and bared
her brown breast to her baby's fumbling lips. She looked
a deep-eyed Madonna, as she sat there, unconscious of
the people around her, a white mantilla framing her face.
Her husband, a clean-featured man, taller than the average
Cuban, stood behind her, smoking, his coarse white
trousers dazzling in the sunshine, his bright purple
"American" shirt worn like a smock, after the "dress"
regulations of Guayabal on Sunday.</p>

<p>Bill drove up presently, and as usual, the straggling
children clustered around the car. He was always dear
with children&mdash;white or black, brown or yellow. They
were instantly his friends.</p>

<p>Wiggles, riding proudly in the front seat, created quite
a sensation, and Mercedes, climbing in to hold him in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
pretty, primrose-dimity lap, had great difficulty in restraining
him.</p>

<p>"Where is his collar, Mavis?" she asked, clutching the
frantic dog to her demure, white frills.</p>

<p>"He was uncomfortable with it, in the heat," I answered.
"Weren't you, Wigglesworth? So I took it
off&mdash;"</p>

<p>The car gave a sudden leap&mdash;and I knew that Bill
had been listening for my answer; knew that he knew that
I could not throw innocent Wiggles away, but that, when
the mask had fallen from Richard Warren, I had, in a fit
of anger, taken away the too-significant collar. It was in
my trunk&mdash;but sometimes I wondered what had happened
to my lucky charm of cool, green jade&mdash;flung from
my window in a moment of pure rage.</p>

<p>Once, I had looked for it&mdash;the day after Mercedes
and I had siesta-ed in the palm-grove&mdash;not since.</p>

<p>When we had arrived home, Wright drew me mysteriously
aside.</p>

<p>"Let me see those last two poems of yours again, will
you, Mavis?" he said. "One of the men I was at college
with wants me to go in with him on a book-shop and
publishing venture&mdash;you know, odd books, quaintly
bound, and all that sort of thing. He has his eye on a
place in Greenwich Village, and just the right, short-haired,
but delusively shrewd girl to run it&mdash;the shop
end, I mean."</p>

<p>"What do you want the verses for?" I asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>Wright grinned.</p>

<p>"If I am to be the Angel in this affair," he said, "how
could I employ celestial qualities better than to boost my
friends&mdash;and incidentally, myself? We can collect your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
poems, publish them in a sufficiently bizarre edition to attract
attention&mdash;and, without letting Mr. John Denton's
solid and conservative firm into the secret&mdash;you can astonish
your husband, by Christmas, say, with a book of
your own."</p>

<p>"But," I argued, "they're not good enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're good enough for me," said Wright magnificently,
"and it will be rather fun, having a business of
this sort to play with. It's one way of revenging myself
on those beastly tin-pans."</p>

<p>I grew just a little excited, picturing Bill's astonishment.
And I would not be there to hear his criticism.
I had a dozen verses or more which Wright had not yet
seen: the best, I thought, of all. And, of the poems I
had styled "Cuban Pastels," the two he had just spoken
of headed the group.</p>

<p class="p2">I gave the verses to Wright, after luncheon,&mdash;all of
them. He could do with them as he liked, I said. Revise,
correct, re-group. I was tired of singing songs, but
I did not tell him that. In my heart I thought I would
be glad to have my verses, bound and shut in a little
book. They would remind me of Cuba, and of other
things, when I was too old, too armoured by time, to feel
the hurt of remembering. I would keep my Diary, too,
against that distant day. Time, I had read, heals all.
It was pleasant to think that sometime the ache in my
breast would be stilled. But I thought perhaps I would
miss it, it would grow to be part of me after a while&mdash;</p>

<p>Mercedes, looking in on me from the flowers screening
the verandah where I sat, asked coaxingly,</p>

<p>"Coming walking with us, Mavis!"</p>

<p>"Us?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Wright, and Billy, and me."</p>

<p>I shook my hand.</p>

<p>"I think not," I answered. "I have some letters to
write."</p>

<p>"Billy said you wouldn't come," said she, pouting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he?"</p>

<p>For a moment I was inclined to reconsider, but the delight
of proving my husband wrong would not have atoned
for an hour of his society. And well I knew that Wright
and Mercedes would, eventually, wander off or get surprisingly
lost, or accomplish one of the fifty odd things
which they managed so ingenuously, and which would
rid them of even the most friendly chaperonage.</p>

<p>Mercedes waited.</p>

<p>"Bill is right," I said, "as always. I think I'll not go,
Mercedes, if you and Wright don't mind."</p>

<p>"Not at all," she said generously, "only," and here her
voice grew wistful, "only the time is getting so short,
Mavis. In two days I'll be going to Havana for the
Mendez dance&mdash;and to stay. And then, before we know
it, you will be going home again."</p>

<p>"But you're following shortly," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"With my family!" she added.</p>

<p>"Won't your Mother consider lending you to me for a
while this summer?" I asked. "I shall be&mdash;" and almost
I had said "so very lonely" before I thought. I
stopped.</p>

<p>"Shall be what?" asked Mercedes, coming up the steps
and dropping to my feet, on a crimson cushion.</p>

<p>"So very glad to see you," I answered, and truly.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Mercedes.</p>

<p>"That's not very nice of you," I accused her.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean&mdash;what you said," she hastened to explain.
"I only meant&mdash;I wonder if Wright would wait
over and go up with us? It is so dull," she went on,
"just travelling with the family, and Father likes him so
much. What do you think, Mavis?"</p>

<p>Mavis thought that without Wright's pleasant, obtuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
presence, that homeward voyage would be a nightmare.
But she did not say so.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he'd love to," I answered, smiling into the
pretty, eager face, "especially if you ask him&mdash;very
nicely."</p>

<p>Mercedes laid her flushed cheek for a minute against
my knees. Through the thin fabric of my gown I could
feel the warmth of it.</p>

<p>"You like Wright, don't you?" she asked, a little anxiously.
"And he's Billy's best friend&mdash;?"</p>

<p>I put my hand on her smooth, heavy hair. A scent, as
of youth and flowers and sunshine came to me from the
polished coils of it. Wright was a very fortunate young
person.</p>

<p>"I'm very fond of him, Silly," said I, "and Bill adores
him. There, is that recommendation enough?"</p>

<p>She jumped up, in a whirl of skirts, and kissed me impetuously:
held me a moment in the clasp of her strong,
young arms, and then, her high heels clicking on the tiles,
ran into the house.</p>

<p>"More than enough," she called over her shoulder.</p>

<p>But when, charmingly hatted, dragging the point of a
butterfly sunshade after her, she went down the path
between Bill and Wright, there was no sign of her recent
agitation on that smooth, creamy cheek.</p>

<p>Left alone, I sighed a little, and looked ahead. They
had fallen in love so wholeheartedly, so gaily, those two.
I pictured them, if all went well, going through life like
the Princess and Prince in the fairy-tale, living "happily
forever after." She could love, I knew, that feather-brained,
big-hearted little friend of mine. She was
young, too, younger than her years, an astonishing thing
in Southern women. She would be easily assimilated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
would adapt herself gracefully. And it was patent that
she thought Wright head and shoulders above the average
cut of men. She had told me so, without knowing it,
over and over again. And Wright, diffident, sensitive
Wright, under his absurdities and his worldly airs? He
would cherish her, I knew, and be good to her all his
life: invest her with a never-failing glamour, make her
his model and his sovereign lady: write madrigals about
her: worship at her tiny feet. It was a very pretty little
Romance....</p>

<p>They would never have pain in their love, I thought:
never know undreamed of depths of agony and self-knowledge:
never know secret shrines despoiled, the altars
overthrown, desecrated....</p>

<p>I heard Peter's voice in the living room, and Sarah's
asking where I was. I called to them and went in.</p>

<p>It was strange, I thought, as I discussed with Sarah the
preliminaries of packing, how much I seemed to know
about Love. I, who had never known, nor felt any save
my Father's and that of my few, placid friends ... and
perhaps that Love that is all dream-stuff. And in my
heart was a voice which questioned and which I dared not
answer. "How do you <i>know</i>?" it said to me. "<i>How
do you know?</i>"</p>

<p>I closed my ears to it and drew Peter into my lap.</p>

<p>"Will you be glad to go home?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Peter, considering, "there's&mdash;Silas."</p>

<p>"So there is," I assented.</p>

<p>"Couldn't he come with us?" asked Peter, coaxingly.
"He could sleep in my room&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked at Sarah, for appreciation of this. Lean, long
Silas lodging in Peter's small nest. And I looked twice.
Sarah, her head bent over an armful of my gowns, was&mdash;<i>blushing</i>!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
I couldn't believe my eyes. I might have
fancied the Rock of Gibraltar moved to such soft symptoms
of complexion, before Sarah.</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah!" I said, in amazement.</p>

<p>The difficult red crept up to her honest eyes. She
raised them and met mine, and what I saw there was very
beautiful.</p>

<p>I put Peter off my lap.</p>

<p>"Run out and play for a while, dear," I said, "before
tea."</p>

<p>And then,</p>

<p>"Sarah?"</p>

<p>"He's a good man, Miss Mavis," she answered, clutching
the gowns to her, ruinously&mdash;my careful Sarah!
"And we're neither of us so young, nor so flighty that
we wouldn't know our own minds. Mr. Reynolds has
written him that he has a buyer for the place, and we
thought that when things was settled down here, Silas
could come up North to Green Hill&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Sarah," I cried out, in childish dismay, "I can't
lose you&mdash;I can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put the gowns on a nearby chair and touched my
hair with her faithful old hand.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Miss Mavis," she said earnestly, "not for a
hundred Silases would I leave you: But Silas spoke to
the Doctor about a place&mdash;and the Doctor said he needed
a man to drive for him, and so, if you want us, we could
both stay on. No one could take care of you," she said,
jealously, "except me."</p>

<p>"Does the Doctor know&mdash;about you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Silas didn't tell him&mdash;and I was going to wait until
we got home. It come all at once," she explained, "but
Silas thinks maybe he's guessed&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>And I had been so blind&mdash;so blind to the times when
Sarah walked out with Silas, for "a breath of air": so
blind to the long silences in the kitchen of an evening,
under Norah's cordial, Irish eyes.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful!" I said, at last. "Silas is a lucky
man. I'm awfully happy for you, Sarah."</p>

<p>"You ain't angry?" she asked timidly. "You don't
think it's foolishness&mdash;at my age?"</p>

<p>"I think it's beautiful," I said, and as she turned to
go, I put out a hand to draw her near, to kiss her. The
only mother I had ever known, faithful, self-sacrificing,
tender&mdash;I was glad that her old age would be sheltered
and made happy for her.</p>

<p>After she had gone, I sat for a long time in silence.
The voices of the others, their steps on the path, aroused
me. And, as I went out obediently to Wright's hail, I
thought of Mercedes&mdash;and now Sarah&mdash;each with her
love-story and her pride: the enchanting, spoiled young
daughter of America and Spain with her poet, and the
elderly woman, austere as her own New England, her
shoulders bent in my service, with a good man of her own
kind&mdash;. Well, Father was left to me, thank God&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p>I felt terribly lonely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XIX</p>

<p class="p2">The morning the Howells' car came to take Mercedes
and Wright to Havana and the Mendez dance, Mrs.
Howells came with it. She would not wait for luncheon,
but had a little talk with me while Mercedes, in a flutter,
was collecting her things. It was a very little talk, and
consisted mostly in shruggings of the maternal shoulders,
lifting of the placid, maternal brows, and half-finished
phrases, unspoken questions. And she left, indolently
satisfied. The tin-pans had won her. I foresaw a cloudless
sky of courtship for Wright, as far as his Mercedes'
mother was concerned.</p>

<p>Mercedes, promising to "return" Wright on the morrow,
was reluctant to go.</p>

<p>"I've been so happy here," she whispered, as she kissed
me good-by. "You'll never know how happy. And I'm
so grateful, Mavis!"</p>

<p>She kissed Bill, too, when her mother's back was turned,
the merest ghost of a caress, brushing his cheek, accompanied
by a little giggle of pure mischief. And he patted
her slim shoulders with a tolerant hand, as he bade her
"run along and enjoy her party."</p>

<p>"My aunt!" said Wright to me, tragically, "couldn't
you persuade the old lady to sit in the front seat with
that brigand in a general's uniform who is driving the
car?"</p>

<p>I waved them farewell with a sinking at my heart. It
was as if Youth and Gaiety were leaving me, hand in
hand, with never a backward glance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>I did not see Bill again until luncheon an hour later.
It was one of our old-time silent meals, although we
talked in a desultory manner, while the slippered servitors
were in the room. Bill passed me salt after the manner
of an ancient monarch handing poison&mdash;with deadly
courtesy. I responded with pepper. And after Wing
and Fong had left us, at the end of the meal, I tried desperately
to make small talk.</p>

<p>"I miss Mercedes so much," I said, "and Wright too."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"It looks like a match," said I presently.</p>

<p>"It does," said Bill, gloomily.</p>

<p>I waited.</p>

<p>"Wright's crazy about her," proffered my husband,
after a time, leaning back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Did he tell you so?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Kept me up one whole night, expatiating on her charms
and his extreme unworthiness," he replied.</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"When I think of the things he said about her at first:
'female leopardess,' and 'did you take him for a lion
tamer?'" I said, "it really is funny."</p>

<p>"A little antagonism at the outset," said Bill, blowing
neat rings, "is very good for the course of true love&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Bill, positively growling, "it's a lottery
anyway&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was so absurd, so little-boyish, so ill-tempered, that
I wanted to mother him. I had seen Peterkins just like
that when things went wrong.&mdash;After all, I thought, it
must be trying to be even temporarily bound to a woman
you dislike so much.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"Speaking of lotteries," I said lightly, "you haven't
heard the results of the last drawing, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "but Silas is counting the hours
until the afternoon when the papers come up&mdash;he bought
half a dozen tickets from that chap who rode up here the
other day&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and called the garage on the
phone. By a miracle, Silas was there, and I heard Bill
ask him the number of his tickets. Then, jotting them
down, he called Havana and some mysterious person and
asked for the winning numbers.</p>

<p>As he spoke in rapid Spanish, I was forced to wait
until he turned from the phone to say, "By George, Silas
has made a killing!"</p>

<p>I jumped up and was at his elbow when he put the
receiver down.</p>

<p>"Oh what is it?" I asked, fairly dancing with excitement.</p>

<p>"Not the big prize," he answered, "but $1500 for all
of that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sarah will die of joy," I began.</p>

<p>"So it's true then," said Bill, interrupting.</p>

<p>"True as true," I answered, "and I think it's splendid."</p>

<p>"I thought there was something afoot," said Bill,
"when Silas asked for a job with me. I was glad to
give him one. He can be useful to me in a hundred
ways. He's a corker&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They could build a little house at the back of the
garden. Father would be so pleased&mdash;" I said, eagerly.
"Sarah wouldn't leave me, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>I stopped.</p>

<p>Bill, with his hat in his hands, turned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be difficult to arrange that," he said, "as you
have made other plans. And I shall leave Green Hill&mdash;so
I am afraid," he concluded evenly, "that a 'little house
in the garden'&mdash;unless <i>you</i> wish to keep Silas on&mdash;wouldn't
be quite feasible."</p>

<p>He went out with that, and it was some time before I
had pulled myself together and gone in to tell Sarah the
news. I saw her later, flying in a most indecorous manner
toward the garage, and knew that she and Silas would
presently be sitting on the step of the car building air-castles
in Green Hill with their new fortune. Well I
knew that one of them would be reared in the back of my
little garden, just as I thoughtless enough, had one. It
wouldn't be fair to hurt Sarah now, I told myself. I
would wait till we were home. Sarah would be sorry&mdash;she
liked Bill&mdash;but Father would keep both Sarah and
Silas on&mdash;the place needed a permanent man-of-all-work....</p>

<p>But there were breakers ahead&mdash;bitter waters. I was
to be spared nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;to the final humiliation.</p>

<p>There was a letter from Father when the mail came in.
It isn't necessary to set it down here. Suffice it to say
that something I had said in my last letter about his
never-failing generosity to me, had called forth a denial
that "the bit of pin-money&mdash;to make you feel independent,
dear!" amounted to anything. And then a word
about the income Bill had settled on me: "I think you
should know, Mavis," he concluded, "although I am
breaking word with Bill. He told me he didn't want your
small, unworldly head to be bothered with money matters.
But it is time that you learned to be practical&mdash;"</p>

<p>He mentioned the little allowance he had insisted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
making me: it would hardly have paid for my shoes.
And eventually it was clear to me that the money in the
bank ... my clothes ... my lovingly purchased gifts
for my friends ... Sarah's wages ... my many extravagances
since coming to Cuba ... everything, everything
had come from the one source ... Bill. And I,
more ignorant than any child about the value of money,
had not even asked, except once. And then he had lied
to me, had told me it was my money, my Father's money,
and all the time I had been living on charity. How well
he knew me, that he took the chance that I would not ask
Father for a definite statement of what allowance he was
making me!</p>

<p>I was overwhelmed with shame and dismay. It seemed
as if this were the proverbial last straw. "They make
gold out of straws, don't they?" my sick brain inquired
childishly. It was hard to think coherently.</p>

<p>I went to the telephone and called the garage. Silas
answered. I managed, somehow, to congratulate him on
the lottery drawing before I asked him to find Dr. Denton,
please, and ask him to come up to the house, if he were
not too busy. I wished to speak to him.</p>

<p>Ten full, wretched minutes I endured before he came.</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter?" he asked, bursting in precipitately.</p>

<p>Mutely, I gave him the letter.</p>

<p>He read it, and crumpled the sheets in his hand.</p>

<p>Instantly on the defensive,</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"Was there any reason to lie to me?" I counter-questioned,
quietly. "You must have known that, sooner or
later, I would know ... if not now, then when I saw
Father again."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>I think my eyes warned him that this was a time for
very plain speaking.</p>

<p>"I had hoped," he answered, after a little pause, "to
persuade your Father to bear me out in what I believed
a harmless enough conspiracy.&mdash;After all," he added,
breaking my persistent silence, "it would be difficult to
explain to your Father that you refused to let me support
you."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I said, rather more gently than I felt,
"to have been more of a burden on you than I knew.
Had I known, had I for one instant dreamed that I would
be dependent on you, I would never have consented to
this arrangement. This may sound very foolish, I know,
and I see now how impossible it all would have been,&mdash;but
this is how I felt, and you, I think, knew."</p>

<p>He nodded, eyes on mine.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he.</p>

<p>"You have had a very pretty revenge," I told him,
each word dropping like a cold, little stone into the hush
of the big room. "You must have laughed, often, to
yourself. No doubt it has been very amusing, waiting
for the bubble to break. If you will make me out a
statement, as nearly as you can, of just how much I
am indebted to you, I will try to repay you little by
little."</p>

<p>I felt the absurdity of the situation, the utter arrogance
and futility of my words as I spoke them. But I had to
speak.</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;" he flung out a protesting hand, "why do
you fret yourself with trifles? Are you not willing to
make some further sacrifice for your Father? When the
time comes for us to separate, I had hoped&mdash;after all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
it would be only the usual thing to do&mdash;to make you an
allowance."</p>

<p>"Did you intend to consult me about it?" I asked,
furiously.</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Please answer," I said.</p>

<p>At my tone, he raised his eyebrows ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"I am waiting," I announced, with dangerous patience.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I admit the situation seemed difficult, but it
was in the future," he answered finally, "and I thought,
perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind. You would have gone out of my life
with the amusing knowledge that you had a hold on me,
to a certain extent? It was well planned," I said, growing
colder and colder minute by minute, until in the
sunny warmth of the windows I shivered uncontrollably.
"But you must have thought me even more of an imbecile
than I am. I owe you," I ended, "a large sum of
money. When we are separated, when Father gets used
to that fact, and when he realizes how well I am, how
strong, there will be some sort of work for me somewhere,
I am sure, that will both occupy my time, and enable me
to repay you."</p>

<p>"Work?" said Bill, and then, under his breath, "My
God!"</p>

<p>He was angry, I knew&mdash;hurt, I felt. And I was glad.</p>

<p>"I am not a&mdash;charity patient, Dr. Denton!" I said,
and left the room.</p>

<p>The rest of that day is a blank to me now. If I had
suffered before, I suffered a thousand-fold now. I could
not look at the miniature. I was even angry with
Father&mdash;dearest Father, who had done his "human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
best" for me. I hated myself, I hated life, I wanted
to die. To be laughed at; to have had my little defiances
and independences met with the secret thought
"the very clothes on her back were bought with my
money"; to have been fooled and fooled again, to his
heart's content; to have lived on the bounty of a man
who despised me, hurt and wounded me at every turn&mdash;it
was unbearable.</p>

<p>When I was home again, when the tangle finally became
unraveled, I would go to Uncle John. I would ask
him frankly what to do; tell him the whole, bitter little
story; ask him to find work for me&mdash;reading proof,
correcting manuscript, scrubbing floors&mdash;I didn't care.
There were business schools, I thought vaguely&mdash;and
cursed the years of invalidism which had kept from me
so much knowledge of the world, so unfitted me to cope
with it, once I was on my material feet.</p>

<p>Father need never know. He would think it a whim,
would be, I imagined, even a little proud, would believe,
even, that I sought to distract myself after the wreck of
my married life. Other women had done the same thing.</p>

<p>I thought of the city as I had seen it: the crowds and
the loneliness and the bleakness of the streets: the hurrying,
uncaring people&mdash;I had read of girls in the city;
the indignities of the boarding house; the strain and the
demand and the difficult way that lies before the untrained
wage-earner&mdash;</p>

<p>Mavis of Green Hill in a New York office! I laughed
aloud at the thought, and the sound of my own voice
frightened me.</p>

<p>I couldn't cry. Somehow, I hadn't a tear left. I
could only clench and unclench my hands on the lap
of the little mauve gown which William Denton had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
bought for me&mdash;I wondered if Mrs. Goodrich knew. It
had been she who had attended to all my purchases before
I left Green Hill, who had gone into town with my
measurements and returned with two trunks full of
everything I needed, and assured me that the "bill was
taken care of."</p>

<p>What a fool I had been!</p>

<p>I did not go out to tea. Sarah brought me something
in my room. I told her I had a headache. It was the
truth. And through my closed door I could hear Bill's
voice asking for me. Mr. Crowell was there; he had
ridden over some time before. I sent my regrets and
stayed in my room.</p>

<p>At dinner I hardly spoke. I was too conscious of the
clothes I wore, the food I ate. The one burdened me,
the other choked me.</p>

<p>Bill, which was unusual, talked nervously all through
the meal, about everything and nothing. Even through
the dull sense of impotence and anger that possessed me,
I could see that he was ill-at-ease, excited, waiting for
something&mdash;waiting, perhaps, for me to reopen the last
painful chapter. He could wait, I thought.</p>

<p>We had just been served with salad, when Fong came
in, brushed Wing aside, and bent over Bill, saying something
very low.</p>

<p>A little gleam of some inner excitement came into the
steel-blue eyes. He flung down his napkin.</p>

<p>"Tell Juan to wait," he said, and rose.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said formally to me, "but I
am afraid that you must eat your dinner alone. Someone
has come up from the village to see me."</p>

<p>"Juan?" I asked. "Is Annunciata ill again?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no," he was clearly impatient and started from
the room.</p>

<p>"Shall I have Norah save some dinner for you?" I
asked, mechanically.</p>

<p>"Don't bother," he said, hesitated, and then, suddenly
crossing the room in four strides, he was beside me. I
felt his hand on my hair and stiffened under the unaccustomed
touch. The hand dropped to his side.</p>

<p>"Don't think so badly of me, Mavis," he said, "even
if you have been a 'charity patient'&mdash;do you know the
Bible meaning of Charity?"</p>

<p>Before I could speak, he was gone. He had not
changed for dinner, a real innovation, and was in riding
things. I heard the ring of the little spurs he wore on
the tiles, and the sound of a closing door.</p>

<p>"The Bible meaning of Charity?" But that was&mdash;that
was&mdash;Love. What did he mean&mdash;a love-patient?</p>

<p>I sat, my hands under my chin, while Wing came and
went with the untasted food. A love-patient?</p>

<p>Something terribly sweet and keen pierced my heart.
It couldn't be. Love wasn't like that&mdash;cruel and wounding
and hurting. Love "suffereth long and is kind."
That was in the Bible too. "Love suffereth long and is
kind&mdash;seeketh not its own&mdash;beareth all things, believeth
all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Love
never faileth."</p>

<p>The big tears ran down my cheeks. "<i>Love never
faileth.</i>"</p>

<p>If it was true then&mdash;"Oh, God, let it be true!" I
prayed, mutely. If it were true then, how blind I had
been! Sacrifice&mdash;patience&mdash;hope&mdash;. Would he have
done so much for someone he despised&mdash;even for revenge?
I began to remember&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>There were voices outside&mdash;loud, excited, almost hysterical&mdash;Was
Bill there? I waited for him in my
chair. I had not moved. He would find me as he had
left me. Perhaps he had come back to tell me what he
had meant. Charity&mdash;Love.</p>

<p>The door flew open and Sarah burst in. She was crying.
I saw that at once, and wanted to say to her,</p>

<p>"So you have heard? It isn't true, Sarah, it wasn't
charity, after all, it was love&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she came straight to me and caught desperately
at my hands,</p>

<p>"Miss Mavis,&mdash;the cane&mdash;it's been set afire&mdash;Silas
is down there, and Dr. Denton&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then I awoke.</p>

<p>"Dr. Denton!" I had her by the shoulders, I was
shaking her&mdash;"Not Dr. Denton!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Mavis. Juan crept up here to warn him.
But those devils fired the cane while he was in this very
house. Fields of it in flame, and Silas there&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was in a chair now, her apron twisted between her
work-worn fingers, the sobs taking her by the throat.</p>

<p>Funny that she could cry like that, I thought, watching
her. I must give her something to make her stop&mdash;if
Bill were here&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bill! Bill!</i></p>

<p>I must have screamed. Sarah, her arms around me,
was herself in a minute, had herself in hand.</p>

<p>"There, there," she said soothingly. "They'll be all
right, I am sure. You're to be calm, Miss Mavis, and
not take on so."</p>

<p>Calm! With the Far Country just within reach&mdash;and
the fire sweeping across the cane-fields.</p>

<p>I put her away from me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>"Go to the kitchen, Sarah dear," I said very quietly,
"and wait for news. Have Wing and Fong gone too?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll wait here," I said. "I had better get out the
Doctor's kit and all the first-aid things. Someone may
be burned&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sobbed at that, but turned and went to the kitchen.</p>

<p>I went into Bill's room.</p>

<p>For a minute I did nothing&mdash;only touched the things
on his bureau&mdash;his brush, his comb&mdash;</p>

<p>A little snap-shot of me stood there. Of me, in a
wheel-chair&mdash;I had forgotten that&mdash;</p>

<p>I opened a leather case which stood on the bureau, it
had his initials on it, and a small key lay beside it.
Opened it and saw my letters to Richard Warren. They
were tossed together, as if he had been reading them.
He had told me that he never kept letters.</p>

<p>Somehow, I found the first-aid things and the little
emergency case. They were on the table by his bed.
And then, taking them into the living-room, I called out
to Sarah to find some linen and tear it into sheets&mdash;we
had very little gauze in the house.</p>

<p>My hands on the first-aid kit, I sat down to think. It
was too bad Wright was not here. He would not lose
his head. But Mercedes would. I was glad she was in
Havana. Suddenly I laughed to think of them, dancing
at the Mendez ball&mdash;</p>

<p>Sarah came in, her hands full of an old sheet.</p>

<p>"Any news?" I asked, steadily.</p>

<p>"It's going fast," she said dully. "You can see it&mdash;"</p>

<p>I went to the window. The whole sky was crimson.
I saw the smoke wreathing up through the flame, fancied
that I heard shouts&mdash;strained my eyes for the sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
a tall, lean figure. He would come soon, I knew, and
tell me that it had been a nightmare, that he was safe,
that he had been in no danger&mdash;</p>

<p>I looked around. Sarah had gone out, quietly. No one
was there.</p>

<p>Softly I went across the room, opened the door, and
slipped like a ghost into the menacing night.</p>

<p>I walked at first. Then ran. The plants and trees
caught at my dress. They wanted to hold me back. I
shook myself free and went on. Nearer and nearer.
How much smoke there was! The whole last crop gone.
Thousands of arrobas of sugar, gone in a breath! Good,
loyal Juan, I thought, as I went on, stumbling, falling
once to my knees. My dress was ruined. Bill will buy
me another, I said aloud. Not Charity&mdash;Love.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was in the midst of it. The flame and the
smoke, the hurrying figures, black with soot and sweat,
digging the trenches that might save the cane.</p>

<p>"Bill!"</p>

<p>My own voice pierced through the smoke and crackle.
I was going on. I would not stop until I had found him.</p>

<p>Was that Bill, blackened, a figure in a dream, his shirt
burned away from one bare shoulder. There were red
marks on his shoulder&mdash;</p>

<p>He didn't hear me? Didn't he want to? Was he
angry? I was sorry I had been so foolish, but I hadn't
known that he cared. Why hadn't he told me? Or had
he tried to, and I wouldn't listen?</p>

<p>"Bill!"</p>

<p>A spark on my dress&mdash;a glare and a flame. I was
part of the roaring and the smoke and the crimson glare
about me, beating at the little, licking, red tongues with
ineffectual hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>Death then? But I wanted to live! It wasn't fair!</p>

<p>Bill!</p>

<p>His arms about me, his bare hands crushing out the
flames, his agonized voice in my ears&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mavis! My darling!&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was safe. I tried to put my arms around his neck,
but they fell weakly to my side. He took my hands in his
and clasped them where they belonged. I was lifted,
borne swiftly through the night.</p>

<p>Crimson flame and smoke&mdash;a roaring&mdash;a voice pleading
with me to raise my head, to answer, only to speak&mdash;.</p>

<p>Darkness....

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XX</p>

<p class="p2">Once, in the night, I awoke&mdash;fully. Before that,
there had been periods of half-stupor, and then, a deep,
restful sleep. But just for a minute, I was wide-awake,
abnormally conscious.</p>

<p>"Bill?"</p>

<p>He was sitting beside the bed. The light was very dim.
His hand was on my bandaged hand which was lying
over the sheet.</p>

<p>"Dearest?"</p>

<p>"You're all right?"</p>

<p>"I'm well," he said, "and you will be much better in
the morning. Close the dear eyes now, and sleep."</p>

<p>"You won't go away?"</p>

<p>"Never. Go to sleep, Mavis."</p>

<p>In the morning he was still there, sleeping, wrapped in
his funny, fuzzy bathrobe, in a big chair close to the bed.
His hand was still on mine.</p>

<p>I looked for a long minute at his tired face. One eyebrow
was burned almost all off. There were marks of
burns on his face. And he was smiling in his sleep.</p>

<p>I felt so rested, so very well, except for a languor and
a weakness. My hands pained me. Both, I was amused
to discover, were bandaged. There was a little burn on
my arm.</p>

<p>Through water and fire&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good morning!" said Bill, smiling at me.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes against the look in his. It was beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
to have him look at me so, but I could not bear it.</p>

<p>"G-Good morning," said I, and felt the hot color flood
my face. From the tips of my toes to the roots of my
hair I was blushing.</p>

<p>It was very early. The sudden tropical dawn was only
a few minutes old. There was a riot of bird-song outside
the window, and a wonderful, dew-washed breeze blowing
through the room.</p>

<p>"Mavis?" said Bill.</p>

<p>He was on his knees beside the bed. I put out one
bandaged hand and clumsily touched his hair.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you've done?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Been a fool, as usual," I suggested, looking ruefully
at the bandages.</p>

<p>"Sweet little fool," he said, in that new, deep voice.
"Mavis, how could you, you frightened me almost to
death&mdash;?"</p>

<p>I thought of those leaping flames, the angry, crimson
sky, and shuddered.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said meekly.</p>

<p>He gave a little low laugh under his quickened breath.</p>

<p>"You love me!" announced my husband arrogantly,
beginning, as usual, at the wrong end.</p>

<p>"Why so I do!" I admitted in a small voice.</p>

<p>His arms went around me, gently, closely, and I shut
my eyes under the touch of his lips on their lids. The
dawn-birds were singing&mdash;in the room: in my heart.</p>

<p>"I love you," said Bill, and kissed my mouth.</p>

<p>I lay quite still then, between tears and laughter.</p>

<p>"It has taken you," I said, "a very long time to find
it out!"</p>

<p>"It took me," he contradicted pleasantly, "about three
minutes. From the very first&mdash;darling."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>"Me, too!" said I, in utter astonishment. It was true.
From the very first. I had fought a good fight, I thought,
as I lay there in my utter content, against this heavenly
surrender. I pity men who never know this wonderful
release of self.</p>

<p>Followed a half-hour of the most ridiculous cross-examination:</p>

<p>"When did you first&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"How could you say&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Whose girl are you, Mavis? Tell me!"</p>

<p>And all the rest of the eternal litany of lovers.</p>

<p>Sarah, peeped in to see how I was. Silas, I discovered
from her beaming countenance, was all right. I had forgotten
to ask. It was with assumed enthusiasm that I
heard that a portion of the cane had been saved. It
really didn't matter&mdash;not to me. Nothing mattered.
Only Bill, and my sense of Harbor in the Far Country
of my dreams&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such a nice fire!" I said, happily, my face on Bill's
one unscarred shoulder.</p>

<p>"You little wretch!"</p>

<p>He kissed me again.</p>

<p>Norah arrived with a very early breakfast. I twisted
in Bill's hold. To no avail. Bar, again, such strong
bars, so tender, so utterly protective.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Norah&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," said Bill in triumph, after the door had been
shut behind the smiling woman, "after all, Mavis, we're
married!"</p>

<p>"Why, so we are!"</p>

<p>I sat up in bed and stared at him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>"It's not fair!" said I, hotly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"We've not even been engaged," I said, "or anything.
I don't like it!"</p>

<p>"Don't you, honestly?"</p>

<p>I shook my head, and then nodded, violently.</p>

<p>"You darling!" said my new Bill. "You lovely little
thing. I adore you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me so before?" I asked, in what
was a deplorably peevish tone.</p>

<p>"Tell you! And get my face slapped! You were the
prickliest small porcupine, for all your soft ways&mdash;rather
not! But Gosh," said Bill, "it was hard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You might have saved us a lot of trouble," said I reproachfully.</p>

<p>He got to his feet and sat on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"Might I? I didn't know, you see. I had had your
repeated assurance that you regarded me as dirt under
your little feet. How could I tell you?"</p>

<p>"You were awfully stupid!" said I, with keen satisfaction.</p>

<p>But he was kissing my finger-tips, protruding stiffly
through the neat bandaging.</p>

<p>"Dear little hands!" he said. "Oh, Mavis&mdash;if anything
had happened to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If anything had happened to <i>you</i>&mdash;!" said I, and for
a moment we looked at each other in a sort of blind
horror. Presently he smiled.</p>

<p>"But we're as right as rain!" said he. "We're young,
all life before us&mdash;and we love each other&mdash;Thank
God!" he ended, on a deep, grave note.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said I, and put my arms up to him.</p>

<p>When he raised his head, his eyes were shining.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>"My beloved wife!" said Bill.</p>

<p>I put him from me for a moment&mdash;looked into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Please," I said, very low, "it's all so new&mdash;and a
little terrifying. I&mdash;I didn't know I could feel like this.
Will you let us go on just as we are&mdash;for a little
while&mdash;? Perhaps I'm silly&mdash;but&mdash;I can't help it.
Please," I begged, "won't you let me get a little used to
you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>His eyes were very tender now.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said. "You know that."</p>

<p>"A real engagement!" said I happily.</p>

<p>"That's the best thing, after all," said Bill, laughing,
"married first, and then engaged for the rest of one's
life!"</p>

<p>He held me very closely.</p>

<p>"I'll cherish you always," he said, "all my life long.
I've wanted you so&mdash;Mavis. You'll never know. God
bless you, my dearest!"</p>

<p>"Father," I said in my heart, "you were right: you
knew. I'm so happy&mdash;"</p>

<p>And my heart answered me.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" said I, sternly, to my husband,
as he laid me back on my pillows and turned away.</p>

<p>"Outside," said he, with the old, impish grin, "to dance
a fandango on the lawn! And, incidentally, to put on
some clothes and pretend an intelligent interest&mdash;which
I don't in the least experience&mdash;in Harry Reynolds
destroyed sugar-crop. Bless those incendiary natives!"
he added, piously.</p>

<p>"Back soon?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me like that!" said Bill severely, "or
I won't be able to go! As your physician I forbid you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
to endanger my pulse. It is hardly normal now. Try and
rest, dear, and when I come back I want to see more
steady color in your cheeks. You've had a pretty bad
shock, Mavis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should say I have!" I said, in tones I vainly tried
to infuse with self-pity. "How about yourself?"</p>

<p>He blew me a kiss&mdash;just a mean, tiny one&mdash;and vanished
without answering, but poked his head in at the door
immediately after, to ask, seriously,</p>

<p>"Shall I bring you a statement of your indebtedness
to me when I return, Mrs. Denton?"</p>

<p>"I wish I'd cost you more," said I, crossly. "You
just wait&mdash;I'm going to buy a trousseau when I get to
New York that will put you in the poor-house. I'm
afraid," said I primly, "that I must ask you to wait for
your settlement, Doctor."</p>

<p>"I'll keep you so in debt," he declared, "that you will
never be able to struggle out, and you'll pay me in love,
young person, for every sleepless night I've spent, and
every swear I've sworn behind closed doors, and for
every time I've wanted to take you in my arms and kiss
you till you cried for mercy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;I shouldn't have cried," I said, reflectively.</p>

<p>He was back in the room again.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," said I, extricating myself with
some difficulty, "what will people think&mdash;door open and
everything?"</p>

<p>But it was fully ten minutes before he really went.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes, and with Father's miniature under my
pillow, tried to sleep. So happy&mdash;so happy! It was
hard to lie still and think. So I didn't think. I kissed
the ring on my finger, under the bandages, half a dozen
times, and slept, at last, drifting from dream into dream.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>Life was very wonderful. And the Love that had suffered
and strayed was the most perfect, at the last. For
all the times I had hurt him, how I would repay my husband,
with depth on depth of devotion. I would make it
up to him&mdash;</p>

<p>Through water and fire....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XXI</p>

<p class="p2">The boat pulled slowly away from the docks. Standing
at the rail, I could plainly see the brilliant feather on
Mercedes' little French hat, nodding in the breeze. A
fleck of white was in her hand, now fluttering frantically,
now at her eyes. Wright, beside her, was gesticulating
like a semaphore, and not far away, Silas was straining
his keen eyes to catch the last glimpse of his Sarah.
Presently the docks faded into a vari-colored blur, and
Bill pulled me away from the rail.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Cuba!" I said, waving my hand for the
last time, as I turned.</p>

<p>"You're not crying?" he asked, teasingly.</p>

<p>"No," I dried my eyes a little defiantly, "but I have
loved it so. Color and warmth and sunshine," I said,
watching the soft pastel shades of the shore line, where
Morro Castle stood, dazzling in the light, its stone feet
set in blue waters, "and I hated to leave, somehow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll go back," said he. "No, don't go below.
Sarah will unpack and settle for you. I bribed the steward
to give us these chairs. Sit down, darling, and let me
tuck you up."</p>

<p>Obediently, I sat, and he sprawled his long length beside
me, cupping his pipe in his hands, to shield the
match flare from the wind.</p>

<p>"But," I argued, "it won't be like going back to 'The
Palms.' I'll hate the nasty people who are going to buy
it&mdash;do you suppose they'll buy Arthur, too?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you want him?" asked Bill.</p>

<p>I turned my hand so that the light fell on the big, new
diamond on my finger. Bill had bought it in Havana,
two days after the fire. It was my engagement ring, he
said, and I had gotten up more than once in the last
few nights to admire it by candle or moonlight. It was
like a drop of dew. I told him that when he gave it to
me, and he had added "on a white flower," and had
kissed the finger he slipped it on.</p>

<p>"Want Arthur? I think not. He'd be the scandal
of Green Hill, and perhaps he'd not thrive away from
Guayabal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall I buy 'The Palms'?" asked Bill, pushing his
cap back from his forehead, so that the sun fell across his
face.</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>He slipped his hand under the rug across my knees
and took mine.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" he asked, gravely.</p>

<p>"I think you are," said I. "Such extravagance!
Delusions of grandeur. But, anyway, I'd rather we built
our own house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So would I," said Bill, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we add to the Green Hill house?" I asked,
"an office for you&mdash;and more rooms? Do you mind?"
I said. "So much of me is in that house. I don't want
to forget those years&mdash;. And I was born there. My
Mother came there as a bride&mdash;and I think Father will
want us to live there always&mdash;unless," I added careful,
"you have other plans, Doctor Denton?"</p>

<p>Bill laughed.</p>

<p>"No. When we get home, if your Father is willing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
I'll turn you loose with painters and carpenters and decorators&mdash;as
long as I may always smoke, even in the
'best parlour' and as long as you don't banish me and
my bottles to the garage&mdash;for we'll have to have a
garage, you know, and I've spoken to Silas about that
little house in the garden. There's lots of room."</p>

<p>"Chintz," I said dreamily, "creton,&mdash;lots of it&mdash;and
another fireplace&mdash;and oodles of bookshelves. Bill, may
I dig in the garden next summer?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," he answered cheerfully.
"You're really remarkably strong&mdash;beyond my wildest
hopes. I was amazed to see how soon you recovered from
the effects of the fire&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked at the little scars on my hands. They would
go, eventually, I knew. Bill had said so. I was a little
sorry.</p>

<p>"Were you?" I asked. "But I had a very good doctor,
and wonderful medicine&mdash;"</p>

<p>He kissed me, to the horror of a passing elderly couple.</p>

<p>"Then," said I, straightening my cap, "you'll practise
in Green Hill, after all? People will say you'll be burying
yourself there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let 'em," said Bill. "I shall have time, at last, for
all the things I want to do. Time, ambition and encouragement.
We'll have a laboratory&mdash;away from the
house, so your little nose won't be offended and turn up
even more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It doesn't," said I, one hand to the insulted feature.</p>

<p>"It does. Don't contradict. I love it!&mdash;A laboratory,"
he went on, "and I can work again on that cancer-cure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bill," I said, "isn't it wonderful? To think that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
perhaps you can bring a blessing to all the world, and I
may help&mdash;a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>We were silent for a while&mdash;such a comfortable, understanding
silence.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mavis," said Peter, appearing suddenly on deck,
"Sarah has gone to bed!"</p>

<p>"Is she ill?" I asked, viewing the water, which was
like blue glass.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Peter gravely, "but she says she's
taking no chances!"</p>

<p>"Poor Sarah!" I said, as Bill laughed. "Stay here
with your uncle, Peterkins, and I'll go and see if I can
do anything for her."</p>

<p>When I returned, I found my young charge and my
husband hanging perilously over the rail, watching the
antics of the flying-fish.</p>

<p>"Aren't they pretty?" I asked, joining them, "like tiny,
colored aeroplanes."</p>

<p>We watched for some time in silence, and then Peter
growing sleepy, for we had gotten up very early that morning,
Bill tucked him into a rug in a chair, and we left him
asleep almost instantly, to walk the deck until luncheon.</p>

<p>"I've got a scheme," said Bill. "Want to hear?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh!" said I.</p>

<p>"New York first. Uncle John's, or, if you'd rather,
a hotel. Your Dad will meet us. We'll ship Sarah
on to Green Hill with Peter, to get the house in order and
to look after the boy until the Goodriches return. When
is it&mdash;ten days? And after you've gone on that shopping
orgy you threatened me with, I'll have one of the men
bring my car down from Green Hill and we'll motor.
Would you like that?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Bill, where?" I asked, skipping a little, and collapsing
up against his side as the boat rolled.</p>

<p>"Cape Cod, I thought, if you'd care about it. There's
a dear old inn at Provincetown&mdash;I know you'd love it.
We could go there, for a week or so&mdash;it's so early yet
we'd have the place to ourselves. And then, early in
May, back to Green Hill and settle for the summer. What
do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think you're a darling!" I answered, brazenly, and
with just the effect I had calculated. And after we had
told each other several times that no one in the world
could be as happy and as much in love as we were&mdash;and
firmly believed it, too I&mdash;Bill said suddenly,</p>

<p>"I cabled Mother from Cuba&mdash;and wrote her. She
will meet us in New York."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," said I, "do you think she'll like
me?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell," said Bill, solemnly, "she's odd. But, after
all, it isn't as if you were a stranger. You've corresponded
with her, you know, and she made you some
bed-socks. That's a bond."</p>

<p>"But that was Richard Warren's mother," I said, not
quite convinced.</p>

<p>"She's mine too. Funny, isn't it? I think you've
committed bigamy."</p>

<p>"Is she really little and blue-eyed and red-haired?"
I asked, "or was that poetic license?"</p>

<p>"Honest truth. She's the prettiest thing in the world&mdash;except
you. And I've written her all about it."</p>

<p>"Did she know that I didn't know you were you?"
I asked somewhat incoherently. But he understood.
That was one of the nice things about Bill&mdash;recently,
anyway. He was the Person Who Understood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she didn't know everything&mdash;not that we
were married."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked, curiously.</p>

<p>He smiled down at me, very big, very protective.</p>

<p>"Why, you see," said Bill gently, "she knew that I
loved you. And she'd got to love you too. After all, she
has a weakness for me, and an unbounded faith in my
choice. And so&mdash;well, I didn't want to disappoint her&mdash;didn't
want her to know how matters stood&mdash;that we
weren't quite happy. So I waited. After a while, I
grew afraid that she would have to be told after all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, don't," I said hastily. "What did you write
her?"</p>

<p>"Cabled first: 'Married Mavis. Meet us in New
York at Uncle John's as soon as you can.' And then, I
wrote and sent it by someone who was sailing sooner.
She will break the trip from California in Chicago, she
has cousins there. I hope the letter will catch her."</p>

<p>"I've never had a mother," I said, the least bit wistfully.</p>

<p>"You have one now," said Bill.</p>

<p>Cuba had long since disappeared. I closed my eyes
for a second to keep the memory of all we had left clear
and vivid. The Palms&mdash;the cane, as it had looked before
the fire, emerald-green and graceful&mdash;the red soil of
Guayabal and the long, white roads&mdash;the mountains in
the distance&mdash;the palm-trees, straight as arrows, with
their rustling tops&mdash;my own orchids, little lavender balloons&mdash;peacocks
and ox-carts&mdash;naked brown babies
creeping in the sun&mdash;sunlight on adobe and thatch&mdash;and
Arthur, screaming raucously for his morning coffee.</p>

<p>No, I would never forget.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>The trip passed like a dream. Peter found some American
children to play with on the boat, and romped with
them under the watchful eyes of a correct English nurse.
Sarah, with Wiggles, kept to her cabin. And Bill and I,
exchanging polite platitudes with the people at our table,
were left very much to ourselves. And the voyage was
calm, totally unlike the one we had taken so many months
before.</p>

<p>It was on the boat that I read some of Richard Warren's
new poems, part of the new volume. And, sitting
in a sheltered corner of the deck, I watched my husband
write the dedication across a white sheet of paper:</p>

<p>"To my wife."</p>

<p>"I'm very proud," said I, a little tremulously. "They
are beautiful. Wright knew. He said they were bigger
and finer than the others. But," I added, "after all, I
fell in love with <i>The Lyric Hour</i>, Bill."</p>

<p>"But these," said Bill, "are your own."</p>

<p>And so they were.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "suppose you show me what you were
so careful to hide from me in Cuba?"</p>

<p>"Did Wright&mdash;?" I began indignantly, "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"No, Wright didn't. But I guessed. Have I written
for nothing all these years? I'm a sleuth when it comes
to a fellow-craftsman. Besides, there's this&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew a crumpled sheet from his inner pocket. I
snatched at it.</p>

<p>"That old thing!" said I, with scorn. "Where did you
find it?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't account for your inky little hands and your
fits of abstraction," he answered, "solely by an explanation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
of your love for letter-writing and your dislike of
me."</p>

<p>"Where did you find it, Creature?" I demanded again.</p>

<p>"In Wright's pocket. Old coat, on a chair&mdash;I was
looking for a match."</p>

<p>"Doesn't sound plausible," said I, spreading out the
blotted paper. Bill read with me, over my shoulder.</p>

<div class="blockquot p2">
<p class="i6"><span class="smcap">After Sunset</span></p>

<p>
Carved in dull ebony, one somber row<br />
Of straight palms, etched in sudden, sharp relief,<br />
Against a molten-copper afterglow....<br />
Oh, Hour of Enchantment, past belief,<br />
When down the garden paths the peacocks go,<br />
In plumed splendor and with stately tread.<br />
Across the shadowed valleys cool winds blow,<br />
From where the smoke-blue mountain rears its head.<br />
Beyond the world's rim, slips the ghost-wan Day,<br />
To draw Night's curtain close about her bed<br />
And set a star to light her to her rest,<br />
While Evening, shaking free her dusky hair,<br />
Lures every weary bird to seek its nest,<br />
And, kissing shut the tired eyes of care,<br />
Lulls Earth to peace upon her gentle breast.</p></div>

<p class="p2">"I didn't mean you to know," I said, as he took the
verse away from me again and put it back in his pocket.</p>

<p>"But you told Wright," said he.</p>

<p>"That was different," I answered, firmly.</p>

<p>"Mad?"</p>

<p>"N-No!"</p>

<p>He slipped his arm around me.</p>

<p>"Mavis," he said very softly, "Mavis with the amber
hair and the deep brown eyes. Mavis, child and poet
and&mdash;all mine."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>"You're not laughing?" I asked anxiously. "I mean,
about the verses?"</p>

<p>"Laughing?" he raised his head from my hair. My
cap had fallen off, and it blew in wildest confusion about
my face and his. "I'm very far from laughing. I'm
proud and happy. But," said he, with a change of tone,
"to steal my thunder! You'll be dabbling in my pill-boxes
yet! I suppose I may as well reconcile myself to
being known as 'the husband of Mavis Denton.' Appalling
outlook!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" I asked impishly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;in that sense at least. 'Husband of The
Poetess.' It wounds my masculine pride."</p>

<p>"It shouldn't," said I, triumphantly, "if it ever happened&mdash;which,
of course, it won't. But I will be quite
content to be known as Richard Warren's wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You dear! But, of course, you have a better disposition
than I have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I haven't! I'm a petulant, snappish, mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're the loveliest thing God ever made!"</p>

<p>And so on, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>The lazy, happy trip over, we sailed importantly into
New York once more. Father and Uncle John were on
the dock, two bronzed, happy men, and it was late that
night before I got to sleep, in that same, old-fashioned
room, my head in a perfect whirl. How we had talked
and laughed, questioned and answered! From the
twinkle in Uncle John's eyes, the tenderest, most quizzical
twinkle, I half-suspected that he knew more than I had
thought. He didn't say so, but if he didn't know&mdash;well,
he had developed perfectly miraculous powers of teasing
since I had left. But he was a dear. And it was so
amazing to sit there and listen to him and Bill discuss the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
new volume, and to put my little, critical oar in now and
then, while Father sat by, my hand in his, a look of the
most wonderful content on his face. They had great difficulty
to persuade me to go to bed. It was fascinating to
linger in the smoky old room, with its rows and rows of
books and its untidy, comfortable, masculine atmosphere.
After I had three times refused to leave them, Bill unceremoniously
picked me up and carried me up the stairs,
kicking, and losing my slippers on the way.</p>

<p>Did I say that a wire was waiting for me when I reached
Uncle John's?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Love to You Both</span>," it read. "<span class="smcap">Will be with You
Wednesday at the Latest</span>," and it was addressed to me,
and signed, "<span class="smcap">Mother</span>."
Wednesday was two days off. I spent the intervening
time in the outrageous shops, Bill stalking uneasily behind
me, deferred to by the lithe, wonderfully coiffured, purring
Goddesses who paraded mannequin after pretty
mannequin before my startled eyes. I think, however,
that Bill was a little more embarrassed than I.</p>

<p>"How they live," he said to me, seriously, on one occasion,
"I don't see. I should think they'd spend most
of their time in a pneumonia ward!"</p>

<p>We drove in the Park one afternoon. It was gay with
Spring flowers and pretty girls. We had a hansom, because
I had read about them in books. Coming back,
through the falling dusk, with the lights of the city twinkling
out, yellow and beckoning, and the great, massive
bulk of the Plaza, illuminated like a birthday cake, just
ahead, I suddenly conceived an affection for New York.
But I didn't want to live there.</p>

<p>"Next time we come," said Bill, "in the Fall, perhaps,
I want to take you to the theatres and to the gayest restaurants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and concerts. Why, you funny child, your eyes
are as big as saucers!"</p>

<p>Our lean horse stumbled just then, and the hansom
gave a seasick lurch. I felt as people mounting camels
must feel. When the horse and I had somewhat recovered,
I answered,</p>

<p>"I'd love it! And you'll teach me to dance&mdash;sometime?&mdash;May
I?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill gravely, "I'm not much of a dancer&mdash;too
big and all that. I always step on the dear things'
feet. But you may, I think, and we'll take lessons together,
if you like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd adore it!" I said.</p>

<p>My husband drew me close&mdash;,</p>

<p>"You baby," he said. "Sometimes I think I have been
selfish, tying you down to a cross old husband before
you've had your good times&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't want any good times without you!" I said, obstinately.</p>

<p>"All right," said he. "We'll have them together. I'll
renew my youth!"</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd! You're a mere infant!"</p>

<p>"Second childhood," he said, "you've been an elixir of
youth to me; of life itself."</p>

<p>"You do say such nice things," I sighed. "That comes
of being a poet!"</p>

<p>"Poet be hanged!" said Bill. "It comes of being in
love&mdash;with&mdash;you&mdash;with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was a very nice drive. After all, the hansom has
advantages. One can sit awfully close, and hold hands
under the shiny, wooden apron.</p>

<p>Wednesday Mother came. I called her that right off.
She was the dearest thing, with such curly red hair and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
eyes the color of Bill's, only a different shape. She was
littler than I even, with hands and feet that were wholly
ridiculous. Father was immediately enchanted with her.
The four of us had a long talk, all one soft Spring day,
interrupted by Uncle John, and by getting Peter and
Sarah safely off to Green Hill. And then, while I was
resting, she had her talk with her son, and came to me
later, after I had gone to bed.</p>

<p>She curled up beside me in a wonderful blue neglig&eacute;e
which made her look like a girl. And we talked&mdash;and
talked.</p>

<p>"You're the nicest thing that Bill has given me," I
said, happily, before she left, "and Bill's the nicest thing
you could give me. You don't feel," I begged, "that I
am taking him away from you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I love you," she answered, the laughter gone from
her eyes, and her face very sweet to see, "for yourself&mdash;for
Bill too, but most of all for yourself. I have
wanted this since he first wrote me about you. I have
prayed for it every night. You were so exactly the sort
of a girl I wanted my boy to marry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," I said, "I was just a little, bed-ridden, useless
creature then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I knew that Bill would cure you," said Mother. "He
always gets what he wants&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doesn't he though?" I interrupted, proudly.</p>

<p>"And he wanted you!"</p>

<p>"I love him so," I whispered against the soft lace at
her breast.</p>

<p>She put her arms very closely around me. I don't know
why I cried.</p>

<p>And then, she talked to me. Just as my own Mother
would have done&mdash;very gravely and tenderly for a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
half-hour. When she left my room, I lay awake a long
time, thinking about her and Bill, wondering if I could
ever be to him all that she had said I would be. I was
happy, a little frightened, and so grateful&mdash;so grateful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p class="center p6">CHAPTER XXII</p>

<p class="p2">The entire household saw us off on our motor trip.
Uncle John beaming, Mrs. Cardigan and the maids waving
hands and aprons, Mother smiling at us through a
mist. She was coming to Green Hill as soon as we were
settled, and help me with my first housekeeping. She had
demurred at first when I begged her to: had said that
"young people were better off alone." But I, and then
Bill, when he found how much I really wanted her
and finally Father had overridden all her objections. I
didn't tell my menfolk that it was delightful to have
someone to whom you could talk "Bill" by the hour, and
who never grew tired of listening and encouraging and
interrupting with paeans of praise of her own.</p>

<p>"What will she think of Mercedes?" I asked, as we
rolled through the city, out toward the sunshine and open
spaces.</p>

<p>"She'll like her," said Bill. "Mother's a judge, and
she adopted Wright long ago."</p>

<p>"Those two wild children," I said, tolerantly.</p>

<p>The maddest cablegram had come to us just before we
left. I was still convulsed by it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mercedes willing wedding in fall out of my head with
happiness everything wonderful thank you a thousand times
will see you very soon most marvelous girl in the world
sends her love so do <i>I</i>.</p>

<p class="left50"><span class="smcap">"WRIGHT"</span></p></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose they expect us to be surprised," I said.
"Ostriches!"</p>

<p>"I always knew you were a matchmaker," said Bill,
"you certainly staged the whole thing well."</p>

<p>"I had her out to amuse you, not Wright," said I, with
partial truth.</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you? 'The best laid plans'&mdash;.
Didn't you know that I haven't had eyes or ears for another
woman since that first night you insulted me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Doctor Jumpy!'" said I, in delighted recollection.</p>

<p>"If it weren't that I have to drive the car&mdash;" said Bill.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, later, you could stop&mdash;" I suggested.</p>

<p>He stopped in the midst of the still considerable traffic.
And then we sped on again, leaving a breathless, open-mouthed
policeman struck into stone, behind us.</p>

<p>"Boston," said I to Bill, after we had been there for
two hours, "is the darnedest place!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it? Cradle of American culture
and everythin'."</p>

<p>"Reminds me of Havana," I said.</p>

<p>"Havana! You're insane!" Bill laid his fork down
and gazed at me in amazement over the table in the
Copley Plaza.</p>

<p>"Because it's so different," I said, "but the streets
aren't much wider, so there. And after all, I think I
could fall in love with the Common, and even Back Bay.
There's something very solid about it all."</p>

<p>As we left the city and went on through the lovely
Massachusetts country, I became more and more enamoured
of my own unknown New England. And Bill,
delightful companion, grew positively instructive. I
learned a little history by the way, and we poked around
and explored, in a very leisurely manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>Wellesley, dignified and gracious, fascinated me. We
went up to the college and spent a happy half-day there
with one of the professors who had been a school friend
of Bill's, no, our Mother's. But I couldn't help thinking
of Mercedes! My bright, tropical bird, caged in a classroom,
filing to chapel with hundreds of other girls, part
of a crowd. I determined to go some day to Vassar and
see her Waterloo for myself.</p>

<p>Pride's Crossing filled me with envy. I liked the beautifully
kept lawns and the wonderful, garden-encircled
houses. But I fell so deeply in love with Gloucester,
even the fish, that Bill despaired of ever getting me away.</p>

<p>"Wait till you see Salem!" he said, "I'll probably have
to tuck a door in the back-seat. You'll want one, I know.
Jolliest doors in the world."</p>

<p>Magnolia, Salem, Plymouth, they went by like dreams.
The big hotels where we stayed, the water, the Spring
skies, the first reticent flowers, and finally, the funny little
Cape towns: Hyannis Port, with its beaches and docks,
its high Sunset Hill, where we watched the sun go down
red and purple over the quiet bay, and where we saw the
white sails of the fishing-crafts lift like wings against the
morning sky&mdash;it was all so lovely, so new, so untarnished
for me. I even loved the grey fog that swept in at night,
like soft veils. And everywhere, serious or gay, always
the perfect comrade, was Bill. I would lie awake in the
mornings listening to him splash in the shower or whistling
to himself in his room, not calling out good morning
to him for five whole minutes, just happy at having him
so near.</p>

<p>But Provincetown!</p>

<p>We came into it on a wonderful, clear morning, into that
sleepy, little town, girdled with sand, on the edge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
wide, blue bay. Some of the cottages were open, even as
early as it was in the season, and the little streets were
bright with people. Our Inn was close down on the
beach, a dark-red, rambling building, built half a century
before, and beautifully remodelled for modern purposes.
There were ships' lanterns and clocks within, a wide,
glassed verandah on which one consumed quantities of
delicious food and salt air, a ship's rope for the banister
of the stairway which led, steeply, up to the second floor.
Beyond the landing was my room, with three great windows
fronting the bay. One could almost have flung
a stone into the water from them.</p>

<p>The room was in rose-color, like my own room at home,
and cool, dull green. Counter-pane, chair cushions, curtains,
and dressing-table rioted with delightfully impossible
roses, and the whole room smelled of salt and sun
and the little lavender and rose-leaf bags I found in
bureau-drawers and on closet-shelves. And my bath was
big and white, a tiled, immaculate room, with cross-stitched
towels and washrags, sweet-scented soaps and a
dazzling array of bottles and toothbrush-mugs.</p>

<p>"How can I clean my razor on this?" demanded Bill,
appearing in my room with a little towel held at arm's
length. He surveyed the silken baskets of flowers designed
upon it, with an air of deep concern.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you mustn't!" I said, snatching it from him
in dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I must!" he contradicted. "Look at this
beard! We left Chatham so early this morning that I
didn't get a moment to shave."</p>

<p>I rubbed my cheek against the square, firm chin.</p>

<p>"Ouch!"</p>

<p>"I told you so!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>"Come with me," I said, with dignity, and led him into
his own bathroom, where I produced for him certain small
towels, hanging under a legend "For your razor," and
left him chuckling.</p>

<p>Bill's room was blue and yellow, and he complained
that it was far too pretty for a man. We were still arguing
about it when we went forth to survey the town. I
popped in and out of shops like "an agitated rabbit," according
to Bill, and bought armsful of bayberry candles,
little delicate water-colors, and about six old, brass knockers;
the last named purchases moving Bill to say that he
supposed we would have to put one on the garage and
another on the hen-coop.</p>

<p>The little inn was deserted save for us, the maids, an
amiable and remarkable colored cook, and the adorable little
lady who was our hostess. She had a tenderness for
brides and grooms! Bill recalled her as having said so
on the one occasion he had lunched with her, in Provincetown,
in the "dark ages before I met you, Mavis," and I
think she was happy to have us there. At all events, she
never said so if she was not, and we stayed for two, wonderful
weeks.</p>

<p>It was too early for swimming, of course, even for Bill's
iron constitution, but we spent hours on the yellow sands,
watching the boats, and the sunlight shifting over the
water. Once a battleship steamed in and anchored not
far away, and that evening there were Navy men in the
porch-dining-room, quite beautiful in their uniforms, very
splendid to look at, under the soft lights of the ships'
lanterns, lingering over their coffee and cigars.</p>

<p>Bill scraped acquaintance with them, of course, with
the consequence that we had tea one afternoon aboard the
ship, with the most cordial and charming hosts in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
world. I had not been there half an hour, palpitant with
excitement, before every unmarried officer present had
gotten me aside on one pretext or another and shown me
the picture of "the prettiest girl in the world, Mrs. Denton!"
And I will say for the Benedicts too, that their
tiny cabins were filled with pictures of wives and babies.
It was a very pleasant tea-hour, but Bill hurried me home
long before I was tired of deck and guns, mascot&mdash;a
frisky goat named "Narcissus," and the crowds of amusing
sailor-boys in their infantile garb.</p>

<p>"Haven't had you to myself for a dog's age," he
growled. "What did those men mean, carrying you off
like that, with their 'Mrs. Denton, please come with me,'
or 'Oh, Mrs. Denton, I've got something to show you.'
Jackasses!"</p>

<p>"I thought them very nice," said I demurely, "especially
that tall one with all the gold braid and the fascinating
eyes."</p>

<p>"Fascinating eyes! Ye Gods! Never again, young
woman!" and he hustled me out of the ship's boat, across
the sand and into the house, lest, as he said, "The eyes-fellow
should be standing with field glasses on the deck
waiting to wave to you again!"</p>

<p>When we were in our rooms again, and I had called
him to hook me up&mdash;we were dressing for dinner&mdash;he
came in and, fumbling with those clever surgeon's fingers
at the hooks of my frock, swept me and the frock suddenly
and breathlessly into his arms.</p>

<p>"Don't keep me waiting too long, Mavis," he said, very
low.</p>

<p>I put my arms around his neck and said something in
his ear. And after a moment he kissed me, very gently,
and let me go. It was ten minutes before I realized that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
he had gone without completing his task of lady's maid.</p>

<p>That night a full moon rose, golden and glamorous, over
the bay. Bill and I walked out on the sands, quite late.
I had on a wooly, white coat over my thin dress, and had
changed to more sensible shoes. After all, I thought, it
was worth a dozen Cubas, the keen, salt air, and the dear
home country, just stirring under the breath of Spring.</p>

<p>"Happy?" asked Bill, as we sat down on some driftwood
logs and watched the ever-widening golden wake
of the moon-boat.</p>

<p>I leaned my head against his shoulder and nodded.</p>

<p>"You've never looked so beautiful," he said, "as tonight."</p>

<p>I drew his tall head down to mine,</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" I whispered, and then, very softly,
"I love you, my husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>Together, in the full glory of the moonlight, we walked
in silence back to the house. The lights gleamed above in
my rose and green bedroom, and the door was open between&mdash;

June.</p>

<p>Has it seemed long to you, little Diary? Yet it is just
a year since my first entry was made. I'm writing now in
my room with the windows wide. Bill has just called up
to me that my pink rose-bush is in flower. I must go
down and see. I can hear Mother on the lawn talking to
Mrs. Goodrich and Father and Peter. Or is it Wiggles?
She employs almost the same tone toward both of them.
And Sarah, a good ten years younger than last year, is
out where the new cottage is soon to be. She has the
builder with her, and I know that they are disagreeing.
It will be a boon to Sarah to have the Simpson tribe&mdash;as
much of it as are carpenters&mdash;working on her house for
her. A pretty revenge!</p>

<p>"A new Doctor has come to Green Hill!" Just a year
ago&mdash;Diary&mdash;and since then so much has happened.
So much sorrow and happiness, loss and gain. It is hard
to believe that it is I who write, Mavis of Green Hill.</p>

<p>The people have been so good since I came home: so
glad for me. They tell me I look a different person&mdash;and
why not, pray? For I am strong and well and most
divinely happy, Diary, and it is pleasant to be able to write
that down for you&mdash;after all the despondencies I did not
spare your pages.</p>

<p>There's the new house to build&mdash;and this one to remodel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
in the Fall&mdash;and the garage already under way.
It will be ready for Silas to putter about in by the time he
comes North. And in August we are to expect Mercedes,
which means Wright, of course. I have been able to persuade
the Howells that Cuba is all very well, but Mercedes
must be married from my house&mdash;and they have consented.
I think that Mr. Howells is glad that it will be so.</p>

<p>The reviewers have been kind to Bill's new book. It
was rushed through and appeared early this month. The
secret has been let out, of course, and the poor villagers of
Green Hill are mightily embarrassed at having harbored
a famous poet for so long without knowing it. And they
get the name quite confused. It's "Doctor Warren" half
the time!</p>

<p>My dear old Dr. Mac has been to see us more than once.
We've had wonderful evenings, in the late June dusk, a
happy family, lacking nothing, content with just living and
loving&mdash;</p>

<p>Mother and Dr. Mac are such friends. She actually
flirts with him, in her Dresden China way, and he growls.
But he likes it. I am sure he is half in love with her already&mdash;he
couldn't very well help being.</p>

<p>Bill's here&mdash;his hand on my shoulder, smelling nicely
of damp, new earth!</p>

<p>"Go away!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'm writing!"</p>

<p>"So I see&mdash;but what, little wife?"</p>

<p>"The end of a story."</p>

<p>And under his eyes, Diary, I have turned back your
pages and drawn a thick, black line through that pitiful
entry made on my wedding day&mdash;drawn a thicker, blacker
line through that sombre little word "Finis."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"Kiss me, William Denton!"</p>

<p>And now, with his kiss on my lips, I have turned back
to what I have just written and am writing, letter by letter,
with a steady hand and a high heart, between laughter
and tears, two firm, exultant words:</p>

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
